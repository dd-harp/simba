title: "Behavioral State Models"
---

The mosquito model developed by Macdonald, used by so many publications since then, reduced most of mosquito ecology to three parameters. It was a model for parasite infection dynamics in mosquitoes in a single population. In **SimBA,** we have developed several new models and algorithms, including *behavioral state models.*
