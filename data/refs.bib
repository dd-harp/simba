	abstract = {Malaria transmission is spatially heterogeneous. This reduces the efficacy of control strategies, but focusing control strategies on clusters or ‘hotspots’ of transmission may be highly effective. Among 1500 homesteads in coastal Kenya we calculated (a) the fraction of febrile children with positive malaria smears per homestead, and (b) the mean age of children with malaria per homestead. These two measures were inversely correlated, indicating that children in homesteads at higher transmission acquire immunity more rapidly. This inverse correlation increased gradually with increasing spatial scale of analysis, and hotspots of febrile malaria were identified at every scale. We found hotspots within hotspots, down to the level of an individual homestead. Febrile malaria hotspots were temporally unstable, but 4 km radius hotspots could be targeted for 1 month following 1 month periods of surveillance., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.001, Malaria remains a formidable threat to public health in tropical regions. The parasite that causes the disease is transmitted to humans by bites from infected mosquitoes, and the complicated lifecycle of the parasite makes developing vaccines difficult. However, preventive strategies are effective at reducing the spread of malaria. The two most widely used and effective strategies are the use of pesticide-treated bed nets to create a barrier between sleeping families and biting mosquitoes, and indoor residual spraying to reduce the numbers of mosquitoes biting sleeping families in homesteads. Other potential preventive strategies include killing mosquito larvae in breeding sites and mass anti-malarial drug treatment for infected humans., Targeting preventive efforts to malaria hotspots—the areas where the risk of malaria transmission is greatest—may help to eliminate malaria more efficiently. Unfortunately, identifying hotspots is complicated as there are many different factors that affect how malaria spreads. These factors range from ecological conditions such as rainfall and soil type, to human effects like population density and migration., Bejon et al. have examined the patterns of malaria transmission in Kenya over 9 years. Over this period, 54\% of children who went to health clinics with a fever tested positive for the parasite that causes malaria. Infected children from areas with the highest rate of malaria infection were, on average, younger than those from less infected regions. This makes sense as in highly affected areas children have a greater chance of encountering the parasite at an early age. They are therefore more likely to get malaria when younger and, as exposure to the parasite can provide some immunity to a child, they are also less likely to get infected again when older., In addition, mapping the spread of malaria reveals hotspots at different geographical scales. Bejon et al. could see hotspots within hotspots, and in some cases could go as far as identifying the individual homesteads most at risk of malaria. Public health workers could potentially use these analyses to identify areas that are likely to be hotspots and then target preventive measures there for the next month. However, the constantly changing locations of the hotspots means workers would have to reanalyse the data and retarget their interventions at the end of each month., DOI:

	abstract = {A common assumption about malaria, dengue, and other mosquito-borne infections is that the two main components of the risk of human infection--the rate at which people are bitten (human biting rate) and the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious--are positively correlated. In fact, these two risk factors are generated by different processes and may be negatively correlated across space and time in heterogeneous environments. Uneven distribution of blood-meal hosts and larval habitat creates a spatial mosaic of demograPhic sources and sinks. Moreover, mosquito populations fluctuate temporally, forced by environmental variables such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity. These sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of mosquito populations generate variability in the human biting rate, in the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious, and in the risk of human infection. To understand how heterogeneity affects the epidemiology of mosquito-borne infections, we developed a set of simple models that incorporate heterogeneity in a stepwise fashion. These models predict that the human biting rate is highest shortly after the mosquito densities peak, near breeding sites where adult mosquitoes emerge, and around the edges of areas where humans are aggregated. In contrast, the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious reflects the age structure of mosquito populations; it peaks where old mosquitoes are found, far from mosquito breeding habitat, and when mosquito population density is declining. Finally, we show that estimates for the average risk of infection that are based on the average entomological inoculation rate are strongly biased in heterogeneous environments.},

Here, we use data from island-wide, annual malaria indicator surveys to investigate human movement patterns and their relationship to Plasmodium falciparum prevalence. Using geostatistical and mathematical modelling, we find that off-island travel is more prevalent in and around the capital, Malabo. The odds of malaria infection among off-island travelers are significantly higher than the rest of the population. We estimate that malaria importation rates are high enough to explain malaria prevalence in much of Malabo and its surroundings, and that local transmission is highest along the West Coast of the island. Despite uncertainty, these estimates of residual transmission and importation serve as a basis for evaluating progress towards elimination and for efficiently allocating resources as Bioko makes the transition from control to elimination.},

	abstract = {With the recent resurgence of vector-borne diseases due to urbanization and development there is an urgent need to understand the dynamics of vector-borne diseases in rapidly changing urban environments. For example, many empirical studies have produced the disturbing finding that diseases continue to persist in modern city centers with zero or low rates of transmission. We develop spatial models of vector-borne disease dynamics on a network of patches to examine how the movement of humans in heterogeneous environments affects transmission. We show that the movement of humans between patches is sufficient to maintain disease persistence in patches with zero transmission. We construct two classes of models using different approaches: (i) Lagrangian models that mimic human commuting behavior and (ii) Eulerian models that mimic human migration. We determine the basic reproduction number R-0 for both modeling approaches. We show that for both approaches that if the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R-0 {\textless} 1) then it is globally stable and if the disease-free equilibrium is unstable (R-0 {\textgreater} 1) then there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium that is globally stable among positive solutions. Finally, we prove in general that Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling approaches are not equivalent. The modeling approaches presented provide a framework to explore spatial vector-borne disease dynamics and control in heterogeneous environments. As an example, we consider two patches in which the disease dies out in both patches when there is no movement between them. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the disease becomes endemic in both patches when humans move between the two patches. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Malaria endemicity in Zanzibar has reached historically low levels, and the epidemiology of malaria transmission is in transition. To capitalize on these gains, Zanzibar has commissioned a feasibility assessment to help inform on whether to move to an elimination campaign. Declining local transmission has refocused attention on imported malaria. Recent studies have shown that anonimized mobile phone records provide a valuable data source for characterizing human movements without compromizing the privacy of phone users. Such movement data in combination with spatial data on P. falciparum endemicity provide a way of characterizing the patterns of parasite carrier movements and the rates of malaria importation, which have been used as part of the malaria elimination feasibility assessment for the islands of Zanzibar. Data and Methods Records encompassing three months of complete mobile phone usage for the period October-December 2008 were obtained from the Zanzibar Telecom (Zantel) mobile phone network company, the principal provider on the islands of Zanzibar. The data included the dates of all phone usage by 770,369 individual anonymous users. Each individual call and message was spatially referenced to one of six areas: Zanzibar and five mainland Tanzania regions. Information on the numbers of Zanzibar residents travelling to the mainland, locations visited and lengths of stay were extracted. Spatial and temporal data on P. falciparum transmission intensity and seasonality enabled linkage of this information to endemicity exposure and, motivated by malaria transmission models, estimates of the expected patterns of parasite importation to be made. RESULTS: Over the three month period studied, 88\% of users made calls that were routed only through masts on Zanzibar, suggesting that no long distance travel was undertaken by this group. Of those who made calls routed through mainland masts the vast majority of trips were estimated to be of less than five days in length, and to the Dar Es Salaam Zantel-defined region. Though this region covered a wide range of transmission intensities, data on total infection numbers in Zanzibar combined with mathematical models enabled informed estimation of transmission exposure and imported infection numbers. These showed that the majority of trips made posed a relatively low risk for parasite importation, but risk groups visiting higher transmission regions for extended periods of time could be identified. CONCLUSION: Anonymous mobile phone records provide valuable information on human movement patterns in areas that are typically data-sparse. Estimates of human movement patterns from Zanzibar to mainland Tanzania suggest that imported malaria risk from this group is heterogeneously distributed; a few people account for most of the risk for imported malaria. In combination with spatial data on malaria endemicity and transmission models, movement patterns derived from phone records can inform on the likely sources and rates of malaria importation. Such information is important for assessing the feasibility of malaria elimination and planning an elimination campaign.},

We use maximum-likelihood estimation in an extension of ideas introduced by Bekessy, Molineaux, \& Storey (1976). The estimation is based on a model for the infection of human hosts with variable degree of superinfection. This model contains a parameter S that equals the maximum number of infections in the host. In the absence of superinfection, S = 1, while S = infinity in the unlimited superinfection assumed by Macdonald.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria prevention in Africa merits particular attention as the world strives toward a better life for the poorest. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) represent a practical means to prevent malaria in Africa, so scaling up coverage to at least 80\% of young children and pregnant women by 2010 is integral to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Targeting individual protection to vulnerable groups is an accepted priority, but community-level impacts of broader population coverage are largely ignored even though they may be just as important. We therefore estimated coverage thresholds for entire populations at which individual- and community-level protection are equivalent, representing rational targets for ITN coverage beyond vulnerable groups. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using field-parameterized malaria transmission models, we show that high (80\% use) but exclusively targeted coverage of young children and pregnant women (representing {\textless}20\% of the population) will deliver limited protection and equity for these vulnerable groups. In contrast, relatively modest coverage (35\%-65\% use, with this threshold depending on ecological scenario and net quality) of all adults and children, rather than just vulnerable groups, can achieve equitable community-wide benefits equivalent to or greater than personal protection. CONCLUSIONS: Coverage of entire populations will be required to accomplish large reductions of the malaria burden in Africa. While coverage of vulnerable groups should still be prioritized, the equitable and communal benefits of wide-scale ITN use by older children and adults should be explicitly promoted and evaluated by national malaria control programmes. ITN use by the majority of entire populations could protect all children in such communities, even those not actually covered by achieving existing personal protection targets of the MDG, Roll Back Malaria Partnership, or the US President's Malaria Initiative.},

	abstract = {The transmission of vector-borne parasites is complex, yet to a large extent this complexity can be unravelled through the insights gained from simple mathematical models of the transmission system. The principle is simple because the key question is merely "what is the rate of increase in numbers of hosts affected?" Clearly, if this rate of increase is greater than unity then the infection can spread, while if it is less than unity it will decline. Ronald Ross in 1911 was the first to formulate this idea for malarial(1) and malaria transmission has since attracted most attention from modellers of parasitic diseases(2-4). But although it is implicitly recognized that nothing- not even parasitic transmission - can increase indefinitely, the importance of some degree of density-dependence in regulating the system tends to be neglected (see Box 1). In this article, Klaus Dietz explores some classical ideas of modelling parasitic disease transmission, emphasizing not only the importance of density dependence but also the importance of knowing exactly where such effects operate in the system.},

	abstract = {The planning and evaluation of parasitic control programmes are complicated by the many interacting population dynamic and programmatic factors that determine infection trends under different control options. A key need is quantification about the status of the parasite system state at any one given timepoint and the dynamic change brought upon that state as an intervention program proceeds. Here, we focus on the control and elimination of the vector-borne disease, lymphatic filariasis, to show how mathematical models of parasite transmission can provide a quantitative framework for aiding the design of parasite elimination and monitoring programs by their ability to support (1) conducting rational analysis and definition of endpoints for different programmatic aims or objectives, including transmission endpoints for disease elimination, (2) undertaking strategic analysis to aid the optimal design of intervention programs to meet set endpoints under different endemic settings and (3) providing support for performing informed evaluations of ongoing programs, including aiding the formation of timely adaptive management strategies to correct for any observed deficiencies in program effectiveness. The results also highlight how the use of a model-based framework will be critical to addressing the impacts of ecological complexities, heterogeneities and uncertainties on effective parasite management and thereby guiding the development of strategies to resolve and overcome such real-world complexities. In particular, we underscore how this approach can provide a link between ecological science and policy by revealing novel tools and measures to appraise and enhance the biological controllability or eradicability of parasitic diseases. We conclude by emphasizing an urgent need to develop and apply flexible adaptive management frameworks informed by mathematical models that are based on learning and reducing uncertainty using monitoring data, apply phased or sequential decision-making to address extant uncertainty and focus on developing ecologically resilient management strategies, in ongoing efforts to control or eliminate filariasis and other parasitic diseases in resource-poor communities.},

The analysis was done separately for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and the limitations of the approach were discussed. The relative rankings suggested that malaria elimination would be most feasible in countries in the Americas and Asia, and least feasible in countries in central and west Africa. The results differed when feasibility was measured by technical or operational factors, highlighting the different types of challenge faced by each country. The results are not intended to be prescriptive, predictive, or to provide absolute assessments of feasibility, but they do show that spatial information is available to facilitate evidence-based assessments of the relative feasibility of malaria elimination by country that can be rapidly updated.},

The first mathematical models of malaria are now more than a century old, and they are still a useful conceptual synthetic description of transmission, but they fail in some important ways. To address some of those failures, malaria transmission models have now been extended to consider malaria immunity, superinfection, and heterogeneous biting, among other factors. These extensions of the basic theory often arise from field studies in a single place, but tests of the theory come comparing standard measures of malaria taken from many places across the transmission spectrum. Several good models now exist that describe these basic patterns across the spectrum from low to high endemicity. The future of malaria modeling will involve applying these models to make decisions about real systems and finding new ways to test the underlying causes of the patterns.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The evolution of drug resistance in malaria parasites highlights a need to identify and evaluate strategies that could extend the useful therapeutic life of anti-malarial drugs. Such strategies are deployed to best effect before resistance has emerged, under conditions of great uncertainty. METHODS: Here, the emergence and spread of resistance was modelled using a hybrid framework to evaluate prospective strategies, estimate the time to drug failure, and weigh uncertainty. The waiting time to appearance was estimated as the product of low mutation rates, drug pressure, and parasite population sizes during treatment. Stochastic persistence and the waiting time to establishment were simulated as an evolving branching process. The subsequent spread of resistance was simulated in simple epidemiological models. RESULTS: Using this framework, the waiting time to the failure of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for malaria was estimated, and a policy of multiple first-line therapies (MFTs) was evaluated. The models quantify the effects of reducing drug pressure in delaying appearance, reducing the chances of establishment, and slowing spread. By using two first-line therapies in a population, it is possible to reduce drug pressure while still treating the full complement of cases. CONCLUSIONS: At a global scale, because of uncertainty about the time to the emergence of ACT resistance, there was a strong case for MFTs to guard against early failure. Our study recommends developing operationally feasible strategies for implementing MFTs, such as distributing different ACTs at the clinic and for home-based care, or formulating different ACTs for children and adults.},

	abstract = {The current and potential future impact of climate change on malaria is of major public health interest. The proposed effects of rising global temperatures on the future spread and intensification of the disease, and on existing malaria morbidity and mortality rates, substantively influence global health policy. The contemporary spatial limits of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and its endemicity within this range, when compared with comparable historical maps, offer unique insights into the changing global epidemiology of malaria over the last century. It has long been known that the range of malaria has contracted through a century of economic development and disease control. Here, for the first time, we quantify this contraction and the global decreases in malaria endemicity since approximately 1900. We compare the magnitude of these changes to the size of effects on malaria endemicity proposed under future climate scenarios and associated with widely used public health interventions. Our findings have two key and often ignored implications with respect to climate change and malaria. First, widespread claims that rising mean temperatures have already led to increases in worldwide malaria morbidity and mortality are largely at odds with observed decreasing global trends in both its endemicity and geographic extent. Second, the proposed future effects of rising temperatures on endemicity are at least one order of magnitude smaller than changes observed since about 1900 and up to two orders of magnitude smaller than those that can be achieved by the effective scale-up of key control measures. Predictions of an intensification of malaria in a warmer world, based on extrapolated empirical relationships or biological mechanisms, must be set against a context of a century of warming that has seen marked global declines in the disease and a substantial weakening of the global correlation between malaria endemicity and climate.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Decisions to eliminate malaria from all or part of a country involve a complex set of factors, and this complexity is compounded by ambiguity surrounding some of the key terminology, most notably "control" and "elimination." It is impossible to forecast resource and operational requirements accurately if endpoints have not been defined clearly, yet even during the Global Malaria Eradication Program, debate raged over the precise definition of "eradication." Analogous deliberations regarding the meaning of "elimination" and "control" are basically nonexistent today despite these terms' core importance to programme planning. To advance the contemporary debate about these issues, this paper presents a historical review of commonly used terms, including control, elimination, and eradication, to help contextualize current understanding of these concepts. The review has been supported by analysis of the underlying mathematical concepts on which these definitions are based through simple branching process models that describe the proliferation of malaria cases following importation. Through this analysis, the importance of pragmatic definitions that are useful for providing malaria control and elimination programmes with a practical set of strategic milestones is emphasized, and it is argued that current conceptions of elimination in particular fail to achieve these requirements. To provide all countries with precise targets, new conceptual definitions are suggested to more precisely describe the old goals of "control" - here more exactly named "controlled low-endemic malaria" - and "elimination." Additionally, it is argued that a third state, called "controlled non-endemic malaria," is required to describe the epidemiological condition in which endemic transmission has been interrupted, but malaria resulting from onwards transmission from imported infections continues to occur at a sufficiently high level that elimination has not been achieved. Finally, guidelines are discussed for deriving the separate operational definitions and metrics that will be required to make these concepts relevant, measurable, and achievable for a particular environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) are an important tool for malaria control. ITNs are effective because they work on several parts of the mosquito feeding cycle, including both adult killing and repelling effects. METHODS: Using an elaborated description of the classic feeding cycle model, simple formulas have been derived to describe how ITNs change mosquito behaviour and the intensity of malaria transmission, as summarized by vectorial capacity and EIR. The predicted changes are illustrated as a function of the frequency of ITN use for four different vector populations using parameter estimates from the literature. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that ITNs simultaneously reduce mosquitoes' lifespans, lengthen the feeding cycle, and by discouraging human biting divert more bites onto non-human hosts. ITNs can substantially reduce vectorial capacity through small changes to all of these quantities. The total reductions in vectorial capacity differ, moreover, depending on baseline behavior in the absence of ITNs. Reductions in lifespan and vectorial capacity are strongest for vector species with high baseline survival. Anthropophilic and zoophilic species are affected differently by ITNs; the feeding cycle is lengthened more for anthrophilic species, and the proportion of bites that are diverted onto non-human hosts is higher for zoophilic species. CONCLUSION: This model suggests that the efficacy of ITNs should be measured as a total reduction in transmission intensity, and that the quantitative effects will differ by species and by transmission intensity. At very high rates of ITN use, ITNs can generate large reductions in transmission intensity that could provide very large reductions in transmission intensity, and effective malaria control in some areas, especially when used in combination with other control measures. At high EIR, ITNs will probably not substantially reduce the parasite rate, but when transmission intensity is low, reductions in vectorial capacity combine with reductions in the parasite rate to generate very large reductions in EIR.},

It concludes that we still cannot reliably measure the scale of some important control problems; e.g., there is considerable uncertainty about the basic reproduction number of malaria. The emergence of new concepts such as strain-specific immunity, and a growing emphasis on disease control as distinct from infection control, mean that some quantitative problems are being redefined more quickly than they are being solved. Population biologists have urged exploration of density-dependent processes which may help or hinder new methods of vector control. This brief review of non-linear phenomena such as facilitation and limitation finds little evidence that they will significantly influence, e.g., the introduction of some novel refractory mechanism into a vector population.},

(1998) from 1991 to 1996 in the Barkedji area in the northern Senegal are employed to discuss and quantify the incidence of rainfall upon the abundances of RVF vectors. We have constructed a non-linear mapping of vector abundances versus rainfall variations, and developed a stochastic model and a corresponding algorithm allowing on output the simulation of RVF mosquito vectors as a function of rainfall trajectories in the course of time. This stochastic mapping of vector abundance is subsequently used to assess the prevalence of RVF in a population of susceptible hosts as a consequence of rainfall.},

	abstract = {Background: Zooprophylaxis, the diversion of disease carrying insects from humans to animals, may reduce transmission of diseases such as malaria. However, as the number of animals increases, improved availability of blood meals may increase mosquito survival, thereby countering the impact of diverting feeds. Methods: Computer simulation was used to examine the effects of animals on the transmission of human diseases by mosquitoes. Three scenarios were modelled: ( 1) endemic transmission, where the animals cannot be infected, eg. malaria; ( 2) epidemic transmission, where the animals cannot be infected but humans remain susceptible, e. g. malaria; ( 3) epidemic disease, where both humans and animals can be infected, but develop sterile immunity, eg. Japanese encephalitis B. For each, the passive impact of animals as well as the use of animals as bait to attract mosquitoes to insecticide was examined. The computer programmes are available from the author. A teaching model accompanies this article. Results: For endemic and epidemic malaria with significant searching-associated vector mortality, changing animal numbers and accessibility had little impact. Changing the accessibility of the humans had a much greater effect. For diseases with an animal amplification cycle, the most critical factor was the proximity of the animals to the mosquito breeding sites. Conclusion: Estimates of searching-associated vector mortality are essential before the effects of changing animal husbandry practices can be predicted. With realistic values of searching-associated vector mortality rates, zooprophylaxis may be ineffective. However, use of animals as bait to attract mosquitoes to insecticide is predicted to be a promising strategy.},

	abstract = {Applications of various control methods were evaluated to determine how to integrate methods so as to minimize the number of human cases of vector-borne diseases. These diseases can be controlled by lowering the number of vector-human contacts (e.g., by pesticide applications or use of repellents), or by lowering the proportion of vectors infected with pathogens (e.g., by lowering or vaccinating reservoir host populations). Control methods should be combined in such a way as to most efficiently lower the probability of human encounter with an infected vector. Simulations using a simple probabilistic model of pathogen transmission suggest that the most efficient way to integrate different control methods is to combine methods that have the same effect (e.g., combine treatments that lower the vector population; or combine treatments that lower pathogen prevalence in vectors). Combining techniques that have different effects (e.g., a technique that lowers vector populations with a technique that lowers pathogen prevalence in vectors) will be less efficient than combining two techniques that both lower vector populations or combining two techniques that both lower pathogen prevalence, costs being the same. Costs of alternative control methods generally differ, so the efficiency of various combinations at lowering human contact with infected vectors should be estimated at available funding levels. Data should be collected from initial trials to improve the effects of subsequent interventions on the number of human cases.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing need to provide spatial distribution maps of the clinical burden of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa. Recent evidence suggests that risk groups and the clinical spectrum of severe malaria are related to the intensity of P. falciparum transmission. Climate operates to affect the vectorial capacity of P. falciparum transmission and this is particularly important in the Horn of Africa and parts of East Africa. We have used a fuzzy logic climate suitability model to define areas of Kenya unsuitable for stable transmission Kenya's unstable transmission areas can be divided into areas where transmission potential is limited by low rainfall or low temperature and, combined, encompass over 8 million people. Among areas of stable transmission are have used empirical data on P. falciparum infection rates among 124 childhood populations in Kenya to develop a climate-based statistical model of transmission intensity. This model correctly identified 75\% (95\% confidence interval CI 70-85) of 3 endemicity classes (low, {\textless}20\%; high, greater than or equal to 70\%; and intermediate parasite prevalences). The model was applied to meteorological and remote sensed data using a geographical information system to provide estimates of endemicity for all of the 1080 populated fourth level administrative regions in Kenya. National census data for 1989 on the childhood populations within each administrative region were projected to provide 1997 estimates. Endemicity-specific estimates of morbidity and mortality were derived from published and unpublished sources and applied to their corresponding exposed-to-risk childhood populations. This combined transmission, population and disease-risk model suggested that every day in Kenya approximately 72 and 400 children below the age of 5 years either die or develop clinical malaria warranting in-patient care, respectively. Despite several limitations, such an approach goes beyond 'best guesses' to provide informed estimates of the geographical burden of malaria and its fatal consequences in Kenya.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traps baited with synthetic human odors have been proposed as suitable technologies for controlling malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. We investigated the potential benefits of such traps for preventing malaria transmission in Africa and the essential characteristics that they should possess so as to be effective. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An existing mathematical model was reformulated to distinguish availability of hosts for attack by mosquitoes from availability of blood per se. This adaptation allowed the effects of pseudo-hosts such as odor-baited mosquito traps, which do not yield blood but which can nonetheless be attacked by the mosquitoes, to be simulated considering communities consisting of users and non-users of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), currently the primary malaria prevention method. We determined that malaria transmission declines as trap coverage (proportion of total availability of all hosts and pseudo hosts that traps constitute) increases. If the traps are more attractive than humans and are located in areas where mosquitoes are most abundant, 20-130 traps per 1000 people would be sufficient to match the impact of 50\% community-wide ITN coverage. If such traps are used to complement ITNs, malaria transmission can be reduced by 99\% or more in most scenarios representative of Africa. However, to match cost-effectiveness of ITNs, the traps delivery, operation and maintenance would have to cost a maximum of US\$4.25 to 27.61 per unit per year. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Odor-baited mosquito traps might potentially be effective and affordable tools for malaria control in Africa, particularly if they are used to complement, rather than replace, existing methods. We recommend that developers should focus on super-attractive baits and cheaper traps to enhance cost-effectiveness, and that the most appropriate way to deploy such technologies is through vertical delivery mechanisms.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0903423106},
	abstract = {The incubation period for malaria parasites within the mosquito is exquisitely temperature-sensitive, so that temperature is a major determinant of malaria risk. Epidemiological models are increasingly used to guide allocation of disease control resources and to assess the likely impact of climate change on global malaria burdens. Temperature-based malaria transmission is generally incorporated into these models using mean monthly temperatures, yet temperatures fluctuate throughout the diurnal cycle. Here we use a thermodynamic malaria development model to demonstrate that temperature fluctuation can substantially alter the incubation period of the parasite, and hence malaria transmission rates. We find that, in general, temperature fluctuation reduces the impact of increases in mean temperature. Diurnal temperature fluctuation around means {\textgreater}21 degrees C slows parasite development compared with constant temperatures, whereas fluctuation around {\textless}21 degrees C speeds development. Consequently, models which ignore diurnal variation overestimate malaria risk in warmer environments and underestimate risk in cooler environments. To illustrate the implications further, we explore the influence of diurnal temperature fluctuation on malaria transmission at a site in the Kenyan Highlands. Based on local meteorological data, we find that the annual epidemics of malaria at this site cannot be explained without invoking the influence of diurnal temperature fluctuation. Moreover, while temperature fluctuation reduces the relative influence of a subtle warming trend apparent over the last 20 years, it nonetheless makes the effects biologically more significant. Such effects of short-term temperature fluctuations have not previously been considered but are central to understanding current malaria transmission and the consequences of climate change.},

	abstract = {Long-term epidemiological data reveal multi-annual fluctuations in the incidence of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever, as well as complex cyclical behaviour in the dynamics of the four serotypes of the dengue virus. It has previously been proposed that these patterns are due to the phenomenon of the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) among dengue serotypes, whereby viral replication is increased during secondary infection with a heterologous serotype; however, recent studies have implied that this positive reinforcement cannot account for the temporal patterns of dengue and that some form of cross-immunity or external forcing is necessary. Here, we show that ADE alone can produce the observed periodicities and desynchronized oscillations of individual serotypes if its effects are decomposed into its two possible manifestations: enhancement of susceptibility to secondary infections and increased transmissibility from individuals suffering from secondary infections. This decomposition not only lowers the level of enhancement necessary for realistic disease patterns but also reduces the risk of stochastic extinction. Furthermore, our analyses reveal a time-lagged correlation between serotype dynamics and disease incidence rates, which could have important implications for understanding the irregular pattern of dengue epidemics.},

We find that in areas of low transmission, the reproductive number and the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans are most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate. In areas of high transmission, the reproductive number is again most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate, but the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans is most sensitive to the human recovery rate. This suggests strategies that target the mosquito biting rate (such as the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying) and those that target the human recovery rate (such as the prompt diagnosis and treatment of infectious individuals) can be successful in controlling malaria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the population of Africa rapidly urbanizes, large populations could be protected from malaria by controlling aquatic stages of mosquitoes if cost-effective and scalable implementation systems can be designed. METHODS: A recently initiated Urban Malaria Control Programme in Dar es Salaam delegates responsibility for routine mosquito control and surveillance to modestly-paid community members, known as Community-Owned Resource Persons (CORPs). New vector surveillance, larviciding and management systems were designed and evaluated in 15 city wards to allow timely collection, interpretation and reaction to entomologic monitoring data using practical procedures that rely on minimal technology. After one year of baseline data collection, operational larviciding with Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis commenced in March 2006 in three selected wards. RESULTS: The procedures and staff management systems described greatly improved standards of larval surveillance relative to that reported at the outset of this programme. In the first year of the programme, over 65,000 potential Anopheles habitats were surveyed by 90 CORPs on a weekly basis. Reaction times to vector surveillance at observations were one day, week and month at ward, municipal and city levels, respectively. One year of community-based larviciding reduced transmission by the primary malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae s.l., by 31\% (95\% C.I. = 21.6-37.6\%; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This novel management, monitoring and evaluation system for implementing routine larviciding of malaria vectors in African cities has shown considerable potential for sustained, rapidly responsive, data-driven and affordable application. Nevertheless, the true programmatic value of larviciding in urban Africa can only be established through longer-term programmes which are stably financed and allow the operational teams and management infrastructures to mature by learning from experience.},

We review the use of this theory for host vector infections and examine its use in the face of heterogeneous transmission. Situations in which there is a marked asymmetry in transmission between host and vector are seen to be of particular interest. For endemic infections, stochasticity leads to variation in prevalence about the endemic level. If these fluctuations are large enough, disease extinction can occur via endemic fade-out. We develop moment equations that quantify the impact of stochasticity, providing insight into the likelihood of stochastic extinction.

Here, we explicitly model mosquito host-seeking processes in the context of local host availability and elucidate the impacts and mechanisms of pyrethroid-treated bed nets in Africa. It has been suggested that excitorepellent insecticides could increase exposure of unprotected humans by concentrating mosquito biting activity on this vulnerable group. This worst-case scenario is confirmed as a possibility where vector populations lack alternative hosts, but an approximate 'break-even' scenario, with users experiencing little overall change in exposure, is more Likely because of increased mosquito mortality white foraging for resources. Insecticidal nets are predicted to have epidemiologically significant impacts on transmission experienced by users and non-users at levels of coverage that can be achieved by sustainable net distribution systems, regardless of excitorepellency or the ecological setting. The results are consistent with the outcome of several randomised controlled trials, predicting enormous reductions in transmission at individual and community levels. As financial support, technology and distribution systems for insecticide-treated nets improve, massive reductions in malaria transmission could be realised.

In this paper, I present an individual-based model of zoonotic arbovirus transmission among birds and mosquitoes. The results of initial ensemble model simulations indicate that the co-location of a vector mosquito oviposition site with an infected bird roost increases the local vector-to-host density and increases the likelihood of arbovirus amplification within the infected roost. Such amplification also increases the likelihood of secondary amplification at other roost sites, produces higher vector and host infection rates, increases the time to virus extinction within the model population, and increases the total number of birds infected. Additional oviposition locations within the model domain also increase the likelihood of secondary amplification. These findings support the idea that spatial clustering of mosquitoes and birds may facilitate arbovirus amplification. This model provides a basis for future exploration of specific zoonotic transmission cycles, including West Nile virus, and could be used to test the efficacy of various control strategies.},

Understanding the factors that determine the intensity of the spillover of this zoonotic pathogen from birds to humans (via mosquitoes) is a prerequisite for predicting and preventing human epidemics. We integrated mosquito feeding behavior with data on the population dynamics and WNV epidemiology of mosquitoes, birds, and humans. We show that Culex pipiens, the dominant enzootic (bird-to-bird) and bridge (bird-to-human) vector of WNV in urbanized areas in the northeast and north-central United States, shifted its feeding preferences from birds to humans by 7-fold during late summer and early fall, coinciding with the dispersal of its preferred host (American robins, Turdus migratorius) and the rise in human WNV infections. We also show that feeding shifts in Cx. tarsalis amplify human WNV epidemics in Colorado and California and occur during periods of robin dispersal and migration. Our results provide a direct explanation for the timing and intensity of human WNV epidemics. Shifts in feeding from competent avian hosts early in an epidemic to incompetent humans after mosquito infection prevalences are high result in synergistic effects that greatly amplify the number of human infections of this and other pathogens. Our results underscore the dramatic effects of vector behavior in driving the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans.},

They apply this approach to the analysis of survey data from Mali, collected in 1965-1998, extracted from the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa database. They use Bayesian geostatistical models to produce smooth maps of estimates of the entomological inoculation rates obtained from the Garki model, allowing for the effect of environmental covariates. Again using the Garki model, they convert kriged entomological inoculation rates values to age-specific malaria prevalence.

Homologues of Py235 are found in other malaria species, and antibodies to both Py235 and P. falciparum homologues inhibit merozoite invasion, suggesting a unique survival strategy involving immune evasion and host adaptation. Using a mathematical approach to model this free-living stage of Plasmodium in interaction with specific antibodies and a heterogeneous red blood cell population, we investigate if, and under what conditions, this mechanism of clonal phenotypic variation can play a role in immune evasion and adaptation to a dynamic erythropoietic environment.},

	abstract = {The within-host and between-host dynamics of malaria are linked in myriad ways, but most obviously by gametocytes, the parasite blood forms transmissible from human to mosquito. Gametocyte dynamics depend on those of non-transmissible blood forms, which stimulate immune responses, impeding transmission as well as within-host parasite densities. These dynamics can, in turn, influence antigenic diversity and recombination between genetically distinct parasites. Here, we embed a differential-equation model of parasite-immune system interactions within each of the individual humans represented in a discrete-event model of Plasmodium falciparum transmission, and examine the effects of human population turnover, parasite antigenic diversity, recombination, and gametocyte production on the dynamics of malaria. Our results indicate that the local persistence of P. falciparum increases with turnover in the human population and antigenic diversity in the parasite, particularly in combination, and that antigenic diversity arising from meiotic recombination in the parasite has complex differential effects on the persistence of founder and progeny genotypes. We also find that reductions in the duration of individual human infectivity to mosquitoes, even if universal, produce population-level effects only if near-absolute, and that, in competition, the persistence and prevalence of parasite genotypes with gametocyte production concordant with data exceed those of genotypes with higher gametocyte production. This new, integrated approach provides a framework for investigating relationships between pathogen dynamics within an individual host and pathogen dynamics within interacting host and vector populations.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models of malaria transmission have been used to inform the design of malaria control programs since the mid 20th century, and many of these models have provided useful insights into the complexity of the disease. Among developing countries, however and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. One of the main difficulties in controlling the most virulent human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, is its genetic diversity, which confounds attempts to design an effective vaccine. The population structure of P. falciparum remains poorly understood but plays a key role in determining epidemiological patterns of disease and the development of immunity. We discuss the seminal model of malaria transmission developed by Ross and MacDonald, and the modifications that have been made since to include more realism. We show that age profiles of disease and serological data support a theoretical model in which the parasite population is diverse and structured into several antigenic types and highlight the implications of this structure for controlling malaria. Lastly, we discuss the current sequence data on parasite antigen genes that are important for the aquisition of immunity, and the results of a new analysis of P. falciparum population structure at the genomic level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: African malaria vectors bite predominantly indoors at night so sleeping under an Insecticide-Treated Net (ITN) can greatly reduce malaria risk. Behavioural adaptation by mosquitoes to increasing ITN coverage could allow vector mosquitoes to bite outside of peak sleeping hours and undermine efficacy of this key malaria prevention measure. METHODS: High coverage with largely untreated nets has been achieved in the Kilombero Valley, southern Tanzania through social marketing programmes. Direct surveys of nightly biting activity by An. gambiae Giles were conducted in the area before (1997) and after (2004) implementation of ITN promotion. A novel analytical model was applied to estimate the effective protection provided by an ITN, based on published experimental hut trials combined with questionnaire surveys of human sleeping behaviour and recorded mosquito biting patterns. RESULTS: An. gambiae was predominantly endophagic and nocturnal in both surveys: Approximately 90\% and 80\% of exposure occurred indoors and during peak sleeping hours, respectively. ITNs consistently conferred {\textgreater}70\% protection against exposure to malaria transmission for users relative to non-users. CONCLUSION: As ITN coverage increases, behavioural adaptation by mosquitoes remains a future possibility. The approach described allows comparison of mosquito biting patterns and ITN efficacy at multiple study sites and times. Initial results indicate ITNs remain highly effective and should remain a top-priority intervention. Combined with recently developed transmission models, this approach allows rapid, informative and cost-effective preliminary comparison of diverse control strategies in terms of protection against exposure before more costly and intensive clinical trials.},

The main difficulty in the assessment of each of these factors was shown to be that of representative and adequate sampling, especially in a sprayed area. In order to compensate for deficiencies in the Kankiya data, especially with regard to the daily and cyclic survival-rates, the gonotrophic cycle and the effective sporogonic period, more complete published data on an Anopheles gambiae population in East Africa were examined, and extrapolations were made from these data in spite of the consequential risks involved.The results of the analysis show that the spraying of an area with DDT reduced the malaria vectorial capacity of Anopheles gambiae sp. B (the main vector of Plasmodium falciparum in the area) by an over-all factor of about 23 times. Nevertheless the basic reproduction rate of the disease is estimated to have averaged slightly over 20 in the sprayed area during the 6 months of the main transmission season. This is consistent with an observed recovery in the parasite rate, which had been reduced to a very low level by regular mass drug administration through the preceding dry season.The analysis was a tentative exercise in "epidemiological entomology" and it is suggested that in the postgraduate teaching of tropical hygiene, the epidemiological approach to entomology should be preferred to the classical morphological-bionomical approach.},

Data from studies spanning over 30 years were utilized 1) to determine the number of infective Culex annulirostris necessary to cause one clinical case, based on known host-feeding patterns and the subclinical infection rate in man, and 2), using mathematical modeling, to calculate the likely duration of the rural amplification phase. Generalized tables were generated which demonstrated that mosquito longevity, extrinsic incubation period, and duration of the feeding cycle were the most important variables predisposing rapid amplification. Although Murray Valley encephalitis transmission may still occur during adverse conditions when the reproduction rate Z less than 1.0, subtraction of the durations of incubation in man prior to clinical onset and the most likely rural amplification period from the dates of onset of clinical infections during January 1951 and 1974 suggested that amplification commenced around October 9-30 and that any Murray Valley encephalitis introduction had occurred by then. Examination of bird and mosquito dispersal prior to this time suggests that long-range dissemination of the virus from endemic northern Australia was unlikely.},

Emphasis is placed on the importance of making anti-malaria action an integral part of primary care. Noting the key importance of local variations in malaria epidemiology that have recently come to light, the book argues for a stratification of the malaria problem based on the characterization of epidemiological zones in terms of their main determinants. To aid the reorientation of malaria programmes along these lines, the book proposes several indicators that can be used to identify the intensity of the local problem and evaluate alterations in the malaria situation caused by either antimalaria operations or coincident natural changes in the behaviour of the disease. Other sections cover strategies for the education and training of health manpower, discuss the implications of recent technological advances in diagnosis, chemotherapy, and vector control, and outline relevant new findings from laboratory and field research},

There is little evidence about the effect on malaria infection in humans that changes in house construction may have. This study examines the impact of protective housing improvements on malaria infection on Bioko Island. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data from the annual malaria indicator surveys between 2009 and 2012 were used to assess trends in housing characteristics and their effect on RDT confirmed malaria infection in household members. Odds ratios were adjusted for socio-economic status of the household.22726 children between the ages of 2 and 14 years were tested for P. falciparum. Prevalence of infection in those living in houses with open eaves was 23.0\% compared to 18.8\% for those living in houses with closed eaves (OR = 0.81, 95\% CI 0.67 - 0.98). The prevalence of infection for children in screened houses was 9.1\% versus 20.1\% for those living in unscreened houses (OR = 0.44, 95\% CI 0.27 - 0.71). The proportion of houses with closed eaves increased from 66.0\% in 2009 to 74.3\% in 2012 (test for trend p = 0.01). The proportion of screened houses remained unchanged over time at 1.3\%. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: As a malaria control intervention, house modification has the advantages that it is not affected by the growing threat of insecticide resistance; it protects all household members equally and at all times while indoors; and it offers protection against a number of vector borne diseases. The study provides evidence in support of efforts to regulate or encourage housing improvements which impede vector access into residences as part of an integrated vector control approach to complement existing measures which have been only partially successful in reducing malaria transmission in some parts of Bioko.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The modeling of malaria vector mosquito populations yields great insight into drivers of malaria transmission at the village scale. Simulation of individual mosquitoes as “agents” in a distributed, dynamic model domain may be greatly beneficial for simulation of spatial relationships of vectors and hosts. METHODS: In this study, an agent-based model is used to simulate the life cycle and movement of individual malaria vector mosquitoes in a Niger Sahel village, with individual simulated mosquitoes interacting with their physical environment as well as humans. Various processes that are known to be epidemiologically important, such as the dependence of parity on flight distance between developmental habitat and blood meal hosts and therefore spatial relationships of pools and houses, are readily simulated using this modeling paradigm. Impacts of perturbations can be evaluated on the basis of vectorial capacity, because the interactions between individuals that make up the population- scale metric vectorial capacity can be easily tracked for simulated mosquitoes and human blood meal hosts, without the need to estimate vectorial capacity parameters. RESULTS: As expected, model results show pronounced impacts of pool source reduction from larvicide application and draining, but with varying degrees of impact depending on the spatial relationship between pools and human habitation. Results highlight the importance of spatially-explicit simulation that can model individuals such as in an agent-based model. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of perturbations on village scale malaria transmission depend on spatial locations of individual mosquitoes, as well as the tracking of relevant life cycle events and characteristics of individual mosquitoes. This study demonstrates advantages of using an agent-based approach for village-scale mosquito simulation to address questions in which spatial relationships are known to be important.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Larval control of malaria vectors has been historically successful in reducing malaria transmission, but largely fell out of favour with the introduction of synthetic insecticides and bed nets. However, an integrated approach to malaria control, including larval control methods, continues to be the best chance for success, in view of insecticide resistance, the behavioural adaptation of the vectors to changing environments and the difficulties of reaching the poorest populations most at risk. Laboratory studies investigating the effects of neem seed (Azadirachta indica) extracts on Anopheles larvae have shown high rates of larval mortality and reductions in adult longevity, as well as low potential for resistance development. METHODS: This paper describes a method whereby seeds of the neem tree can be used to reduce adult Anopheles gambiae s.l. abundance in a way that is low cost and can be implemented by residents of rural villages in western Niger. The study was conducted in Banizoumbou village, western Niger. Neem seeds were collected from around the village. Dried seeds were ground into a coarse powder, which was then sprinkled onto known Anopheles larvae breeding habitats twice weekly during the rainy season 2007. Adult mosquitoes were captured on a weekly basis in the village and captures compared to those from 2005 and 2006 over the same period. Adult mosquitoes were also captured in a nearby village, Zindarou, as a control data set and compared to those from Banizoumbou. RESULTS: It was found that twice-weekly applications of the powder to known breeding habitats of Anopheles larvae in 2007 resulted in 49\% fewer adult female Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes in Banizoumbou, compared with previous captures under similar environmental conditions and with similar habitat characteristics in 2005 and 2006. The productivity of the system in 2007 was found to be suppressed compared to the mean behaviour of 2005 and 2006 in Banizoumbou, whereas no change was found in Zindarou. CONCLUSION: With a high abundance of neem plants in many villages in this area, the results of this study suggest that larval control using neem seed powder offers a sustainable additional tool for malaria vector control in the Sahel region of Niger.},

	abstract = {Changes in land use and climate are expected to alter the risk of malaria transmission in areas where rainfall limits vector abundance. We use a coupled hydrology-entomology model to investigate the effects of land use change on hydrological processes impacting mosquito abundance in a highland village of Ethiopia. Land use affects partitioning of rainfall into infiltration and runoff that reaches small-scale topographic depressions, which constitute the primary breeding habitat of Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes. A physically based hydrology model isolates hydrological mechanisms by which land use impacts pool formation and persistence, and an agent-based entomology model evaluates the response of mosquito populations. This approach reproduced observed interannual variability in mosquito abundance between the 2009 and 2010 wet seasons. Several scenarios of land cover were then evaluated using the calibrated, field-validated model. Model results show variation in pool persistence and depth, as well as in mosquito abundance, due to land use changes alone. The model showed particular sensitivity to surface roughness, but also to root zone uptake. Scenarios in which land use was modified from agriculture to forest generally resulted in lowest mosquito abundance predictions; classification of the entire domain as rainforest produced a 34\% decrease in abundance compared to 2010 results. This study also showed that in addition to vegetation type, spatial proximity of land use change to habitat locations has an impact on mosquito abundance. This modeling approach can be applied to assess impacts of climate and land use conditions that fall outside of the range of previously observed variability.},

	abstract = {Dynamical malaria models can relate precipitation to the availability of vector breeding sites using simple models of surface hydrology. Here, a revised scheme is developed for the VECTRI malaria model, which is evaluated alongside the default scheme using a two year simulation by HYDREMATS, a 10 metre resolution, village-scale model that explicitly simulates individual ponds. Despite the simplicity of the two VECTRI surface hydrology parametrization schemes, they can reproduce the sub-seasonal evolution of fractional water coverage. Calibration of the model parameters is required to simulate the mean pond fraction correctly. The default VECTRI model tended to overestimate water fraction in periods subject to light rainfall events and underestimate it during periods of intense rainfall. This systematic error was improved in the revised scheme by including the a parametrization for surface run-off, such that light rainfall below the initial abstraction threshold does not contribute to ponds. After calibration of the pond model, the VECTRI model was able to simulate vector densities that compared well to the detailed agent based model contained in HYDREMATS without further parameter adjustment. Substituting local rain-gauge data with satellite-retrieved precipitation gave a reasonable approximation, raising the prospects for regional malaria simulations even in data sparse regions. However, further improvements could be made if a method can be derived to calibrate the key hydrology parameters of the pond model in each grid cell location, possibly also incorporating slope and soil texture.},

	abstract = {Seasonal total precipitation is well known to affect malaria transmission because Anopheles mosquitoes depend on standing water for breeding habitat. However, the within-season temporal pattern of the rainfall influences persistence of standing water and thus rainfall patterns can also affect mosquito population dynamics in water-limited environments. Here, using a numerical simulation, I show that intraseasonal rainfall pattern accounts for 39\% of the variance in simulated mosquito abundance in a Niger Sahel village where malaria is endemic but highly seasonal. I apply a field validated coupled hydrology and entomology model. Using synthetic rainfall time series generated using a stationary first-order Markov Chain model, I hold all variables except hourly rainfall constant, thus isolating the contribution of rainfall pattern to variance in mosquito abundance. I further show the utility of hydrology modeling using topography to assess precipitation effects by analyzing collected water. Time-integrated surface area of pools explains 70\% of the variance in simulated mosquito abundance from a mechanistic model, and time-integrated surface area of pools persisting longer than 7 days explains 82\% of the variance. Correlations using the hydrology model output explain more variance in mosquito abundance than the 60\% from rainfall totals. I extend this analysis to investigate the impacts of this effect on malaria vector mosquito populations under climate shift scenarios, holding all climate variables except precipitation constant. In these scenarios, rainfall mean and variance change with climatic change, and the modeling approach evaluates the impact of non-stationarity in rainfall and the associated rainfall patterns on expected mosquito activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Housing mapping and household enumeration are essential for the planning, implementation, targeting, and monitoring of malaria control interventions. In many malaria endemic countries, control efforts are hindered by incomplete or non-existent housing cartography and household enumeration. This paper describes the development of a comprehensive mapping and enumeration system to support the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP). RESULTS: A highly detailed database was developed to include every housing unit on Bioko Island and uniquely enumerate the associated households residing in these houses. First, the island was divided into a virtual, geo-dereferenced grid of 1 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 1 km sequentially numbered map-areas, each of which was in turn subdivided into one hundred, 100 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 100 m sequentially numbered map-sectors. Second, high-resolution satellite imagery was used to sequentially and uniquely identify all housing units within each map-sector. Third, where satellite imagery was not available, global positioning systems (GPS) were used as the basis for uniquely identifying and mapping housing units in a sequential manner. A total of 97,048 housing units were mapped by 2018, 56\% of which were concentrated in just 5.2\% of Bioko Island's total mapped area. Of these housing units, 70.7\% were occupied, thus representing uniquely identified households. CONCLUSIONS: The housing unit mapping and household enumeration system developed for Bioko Island enabled the BIMCP to more effectively plan, implement, target, and monitor malaria control interventions. Since 2014, the BIMCP has used the unique household identifiers to monitor all household-level interventions, including indoor residual spraying, long-lasting insecticide-treated nets distribution, and annual malaria indicator surveys. The coding system used to create the unique housing unit and household identifiers is highly intuitive and allows quick location of any house within the grid without a GPS. Its flexibility has permitted the BIMCP to easily take into account the rapid and substantial changes in housing infrastructure. Importantly, by utilizing this coding system, an unprecedented quantity and diversity of detailed, geo-referenced demographic and health data have been assembled that have proved highly relevant for informing decision-making both for malaria control and potentially for the wider public health agenda on Bioko Island.},

	abstract = {A synoptic view is given of the data amassed by WHO, with technical assistance from the Imperial College of Science and Technology, on the origins of blood-meals in Anopheles samples collected from 1971 to 1978. Attention is focused on the proportion of each sample found to contain human blood and on the problems of interpreting from this the human blood index or degree of biting-contact with man exhibited by vector populations. The difficulties of overcoming bias in sampling, which are formidable in unsprayed areas, are further compounded where the dwellings are treated with a slow-acting residual insecticide which knocks down many engorged mosquitoes before they can be collected from their daytime resting places. There is evidence to suggest that the host-selection patterns of those vectors which are `opportunistic' feeders may be heavily influenced, even from village to village or from month to month, by the changing availability of alternative hosts, particularly cattle. This suggests in turn that the possibilities of manipulating the degree of mosquito-man contact by encouraging deflection to animals (zooprophylaxis) or by measures to afford a degree of personal protection should not be under-estimated by malaria strategists. It may sometimes be found less difficult to reduce the vector's human blood index than it is to measure it, but in view of the epidemiological importance of this parameter, suggestions are put forward for improving entomological field practice in this area. They include a quantitative survey of the biotopes available to the mosquito population as diurnal shelters, a longitudinal survey of the densities of blood-fed females per biotope, and a survey of the numbers and the respective distribution of people and domestic animals available as hosts. The work-load entailed by such a thorough form of investigation, to be repeated where necessary at different seasons of the year, underlines the necessity to concentrate efforts on a small number of localities, carefully chosen for the malaria situations they represent and the vector populations they support. A large-scale blood-meal sampling programme, confined to these selected localities, is most likely in our estimation to yield information of value for controlling malaria vectors.},

In a routine survey in 1971, when the testing was not as exhaustive, mixed meals were detected in only 2 (0.1\%) of 1 798 smears tested. In the 1970 study, no mixed meals were found in pit-shelters, suggesting that a mosquito interrupted while feeding out of doors tends to move to an indoor biotope to complete its meal. A portion of the multiple meals -i.e., those completed on the same host species-could not be detected by the precipitin test. The frequencies of these “cryptic” multiple meals were calculated for the three main biotopes studied. The human blood index derived from these tests suggests that, in the absence of insecticidal spraying for 10 years, the host selection pattern of the mosquito had reverted to that found before the malaria eradication programme in Greece commenced.},

	abstract = {Summary The authors, in collaboration with the staff of CNEP, Mexico, carried out an investigation of persistent malaria transmission in a coastal area of the State of Oaxaca from May through August 1962. The area had been thoroughly sprayed with DDT for five years, and spraying continues. In a detailed survey of malaria cases and housing in ten villages, it was found that malaria-positive houses tended to be in isolated positions, to be smaller than average, to have more inhabitants and to show a greater discontinuity in, and lack of, walls than the negative ones. A study of malaria cases detected by various methods among 29,216 inhabitants of the area over a period of 30 months showed an annual incidence (including relapses) of 1.32\% in this population. The incidence was substantially higher in the second half of each year than in the first, and there was a general upward trend between 1960 and 1962. DDT was applied at average intervals of six months, but spraying within the area was distributed randomly through the year. Counting of the cases detected when the DDT deposits were less and more than three months old, respectively, showed an increase from 2.46\% to 3.49\% in the proportion of slides positive when the insecticide deposits were old, although only very small amounts of unsprayed interior surface were then present. The vector anophelines found biting man were Anopheles pseudopunctipennis and A. albimanus. Both bit human baits freely outside and inside the sprayed houses. Although the relative incidence of indoor biting was somewhat reduced in the weeks following spraying, the habit of the people of sleeping nearly always indoors meant that the bulk of contact between them and the vectors must occur within the houses. The vectors were found susceptible to DDT (with some indication of incipient resistance in A. albimanus), while the small numbers caught in window-traps were shown to leave the houses soon after biting and to have a low 24-hour mortality rate thereafter. The two vectors are considered to be highly irritable by DDT and to escape easily from the treated houses. During the investigation it was observed that malaria transmission could take place in spite of low vector densities.},

	abstract = {Climate affects malaria transmission through a complex network of causative pathways. We seek to evaluate the impact of hypothetical climate change scenarios on malaria transmission in the Sahel by using a novel mechanistic, high spatial- and temporal-resolution coupled hydrology and agent-based entomology model. The hydrology model component resolves individual precipitation events and individual breeding pools. The impact of future potential climate shifts on the representative Sahel village of Banizoumbou, Niger, is estimated by forcing the model of Banizoumbou environment with meteorological data from two locations along the north-south climatological gradient observed in the Sahel–both for warmer, drier scenarios from the north and cooler, wetter scenarios from the south. These shifts in climate represent hypothetical but historically realistic climate change scenarios. For Banizoumbou climatic conditions (latitude 13.54 N), a shift toward cooler, wetter conditions may dramatically increase mosquito abundance; however, our modeling results indicate that the increased malaria transmissibility is not simply proportional to the precipitation increase. The cooler, wetter conditions increase the length of the sporogonic cycle, dampening a large vectorial capacity increase otherwise brought about by increased mosquito survival and greater overall abundance. Furthermore, simulations varying rainfall event frequency demonstrate the importance of precipitation patterns, rather than simply average or time-integrated precipitation, as a controlling factor of these dynamics. Modeling results suggest that in addition to changes in temperature and total precipitation, changes in rainfall patterns are very important to predict changes in disease susceptibility resulting from climate shifts. The combined effect of these climate-shift-induced perturbations can be represented with the aid of a detailed mechanistic model.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYClassical studies of non-immune individuals infected with Plasmodium falciparum reveal that the infection may be regulated for long periods at a relatively stable parasite density, despite the enormous growth potential of a parasite that continually replicates within host erythrocytes. This suggests that the parasite population may be controlled by density-dependent mechanisms, and in theory the most obvious of these is competition between parasites for host erythrocytes. Here we evaluate the role of this mechanism in the regulation of parasitaemia, by modelling the basic population interaction between parasites and erythrocytes in a form that allows all the essential parameters to be estimated from clinical data. Our results show that competition cannot account for the total regulation of P. falciparum, but when combined with immune mechanisms it may play a more important role than is generally supposed. Further analysis of the model indicates that in the long term, parasite replication at low parasite densities can contribute significantly to the high degree of anaemia observed in natural infection, a conclusion which is not obvious from simple clinical observation.},

	abstract = {Establishing the relationship between transmission intensity and health outcomes is crucial for the planning of long-term malaria control programs. Unfortunately this is fraught with methodologic difficulties. In this report, we address some of these problems by considering some important parameters that have previously been ignored. One important consideration is that the incidence of infection for Plasmodium falciparum malaria is much lower than entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs), especially at higher transmission levels. Moreover, biting rates of malaria vectors per host depend on his or her biomass and thus age. We propose an algorithm for estimating human infection rates from the EIR with allowance for these two factors. We then re-analyzed 1) data on EIR and age-specific incidence of clinical malaria in two villages in Senegal and 2) a survey of infant and child mortality rates across Africa. In each case, we review analyses of incidence in relation to the EIR and carry out a new analysis of morbidity and mortality rates in relation to the estimated incidence of infection (h). Reduction in malaria transmission may result in a shift of acute malaria attacks to older ages, and thus have little impact on life-time risk of clinical attacks. However, our analysis of the Senegalese data indicates that the peak incidence rate of disease relative to infection rates is in the youngest age groups in both the villages of Dielmo (EIR = 200 infectious bites per year) and Ndiop (EIR = 20). This suggests that simple models of acquired clinical immunity can explain age-incidence profiles better when incidence is expressed in relation to h, than when expressed in relation to the EIR. Relationships of malaria transmission intensity (in endemic areas) with overall mortality are very different from those with acute morbidity. Infant mortality rates (IMRs) decrease substantially when the EIR is reduced, probably largely because of prevention of indirect mortality. However, we were are not yet able to draw strong conclusions about the shape of relationships between the IMR and h because many of the available data points have similar values of h. The effects of transmission reduction on mortality rates in older age groups are also uncertain. However, it is clear that reduction of exposure during infancy is not reflected in increased mortality at older ages.},

	abstract = {Resistance to first-line treatments for Plasmodium falciparum malaria and the insecticides used for Anopheles vector control are threatening malaria elimination efforts. Suboptimal responses to drugs and insecticides are both spreading geographically and emerging independently and are being seen at increasing intensities. Whilst resistance is unavoidable, its effects can be mitigated through resistance management practices, such as exposing the parasite or vector to more than one selective agent. Resistance contributed to the failure of the 20th century Global Malaria Eradication Programme, and yet the global response to this issue continues to be slow and poorly coordinated-too often, too little, too late. The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) Refresh process convened a panel on resistance of both insecticides and antimalarial drugs. This paper outlines developments in the field over the past 5 years, highlights gaps in knowledge, and proposes a research agenda focused on managing resistance. A deeper understanding of the complex biological processes involved and how resistance is selected is needed, together with evidence of its public health impact. Resistance management will require improved use of entomological and parasitological data in decision making, and optimisation of the useful life of new and existing products through careful implementation, combination, and evaluation. A proactive, collaborative approach is needed from basic science and the development of new tools to programme and policy interventions that will ensure that the armamentarium of drugs and insecticides is sufficient to deal with the challenges of malaria control and its elimination.},

	abstract = {This paper summarises key advances in defining the infectious reservoir for malaria and the measurement of transmission for research and programmatic use since the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) publication in 2011. Rapid and effective progress towards elimination requires an improved understanding of the sources of transmission as well as those at risk of infection. Characterising the transmission reservoir in different settings will enable the most appropriate choice, delivery, and evaluation of interventions. Since 2011, progress has been made in a number of areas. The extent of submicroscopic and asymptomatic infections is better understood, as are the biological parameters governing transmission of sexual stage parasites. Limitations of existing transmission measures have been documented, and proof-of-concept has been established for new innovative serological and molecular methods to better characterise transmission. Finally, there now exists a concerted effort towards the use of ensemble datasets across the spectrum of metrics, from passive and active sources, to develop more accurate risk maps of transmission. These can be used to better target interventions and effectively monitor progress toward elimination. The success of interventions depends not only on the level of endemicity but also on how rapidly or recently an area has undergone changes in transmission. Improved understanding of the biology of mosquito-human and human-mosquito transmission is needed particularly in low-endemic settings, where heterogeneity of infection is pronounced and local vector ecology is variable. New and improved measures of transmission need to be operationally feasible for the malaria programmes. Outputs from these research priorities should allow the development of a set of approaches (applicable to both research and control programmes) that address the unique challenges of measuring and monitoring transmission in near-elimination settings and defining the absence of transmission.},

These advances have once again put malaria elimination on the agenda. However, it is clear that even with the means available today, malaria control and elimination pose a formidable challenge in many settings. Thus, currently available resources must be used more effectively, and new products and approaches likely to achieve these goals must be developed. This paper considers tools (both those available and others that may be required) to achieve and maintain malaria elimination. New diagnostics are needed to direct treatment and detect transmission potential; new drugs and vaccines to overcome existing resistance and protect against clinical and severe disease, as well as block transmission and prevent relapses; and new vector control measures to overcome insecticide resistance and more powerfully interrupt transmission. It is also essential that strategies for combining new and existing approaches are developed for different settings to maximise their longevity and effectiveness in areas with continuing transmission and receptivity. For areas where local elimination has been recently achieved, understanding which measures are needed to maintain elimination is necessary to prevent rebound and the reestablishment of transmission. This becomes increasingly important as more countries move towards elimination.},

The malaria eradication research agenda (malERA) Refresh consultative process for the Panel on Health Systems and Policy Research identifies opportunities to build health systems evidence and the tools needed to eliminate malaria from different zones, countries, and regions and to eradicate it globally.

This supports the promotion of an actionable and more cohesive approach to building the evidence base for scaled-up implementation of findings. Gaps and opportunities discussed in the paper include delivery strategies to meet the changing dynamics of needs of individuals, environments, and malaria programme successes; mechanisms and approaches to best support accelerated policy and financial responsiveness at national and global level to ensure timely response to evidence and needs, including in crisis situations; and systems' readiness tools and decision-support systems.},

Between January and April, confirmed malaria cases increased 3.8-fold compared to the same period in 2018. Concurrently, anopheline human biting rate (HBR) increased 2.1-fold. During the outbreak, 82.2\% of the district population was tested for malaria with a rapid diagnostic test; 37.2\% of those tested had a detectable infection and were treated according to national guidelines. Vector control interventions, including indoor residual spraying and larval source management were scaled-up. After the interventions, the number of confirmed cases decreased by 70\% and the overall parasite prevalence in the communities by 43.8\%. Observed prevalence in a follow up malaria indicator survey, however, was significantly higher than elsewhere on the island, and higher than in previous years. There was no significant reduction in HBR, which remained high for the rest of the year. The surge was attributed to various factors, chiefly increased rainfall and a large number of anthropogenic anopheline breeding sites created by construction works. This case study highlights the need for sustained vector control interventions and multi-sector participation, particularly in malaria control and elimination settings with persistently high local malaria receptivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Much of the extensive research regarding transmission of malaria is underpinned by mathematical modelling. Compartmental models, which focus on interactions and transitions between population strata, have been a mainstay of such modelling for more than a century. However, modellers are increasingly adopting agent-based approaches, which model hosts, vectors and/or their interactions on an individual level. One reason for the increasing popularity of such models is their potential to provide enhanced realism by allowing system-level behaviours to emerge as a consequence of accumulated individual-level interactions, as occurs in real populations. METHODS: A systematic review of 90 articles published between 1998 and May 2018 was performed, characterizing agent-based models (ABMs) relevant to malaria transmission. The review provides an overview of approaches used to date, determines the advantages of these approaches, and proposes ideas for progressing the field. RESULTS: The rationale for ABM use over other modelling approaches centres around three points: the need to accurately represent increased stochasticity in low-transmission settings; the benefits of high-resolution spatial simulations; and heterogeneities in drug and vaccine efficacies due to individual patient characteristics. The success of these approaches provides avenues for further exploration of agent-based techniques for modelling malaria transmission. Potential extensions include varying elimination strategies across spatial landscapes, extending the size of spatial models, incorporating human movement dynamics, and developing increasingly comprehensive parameter estimation and optimization techniques. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the literature covers an extensive array of topics, including the full spectrum of transmission and intervention regimes. Bringing these elements together under a common framework may enhance knowledge of, and guide policies towards, malaria elimination. However, because of the diversity of available models, endorsing a standardized approach to ABM implementation may not be possible. Instead it is recommended that model frameworks be contextually appropriate and sufficiently described. One key recommendation is to develop enhanced parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Extensions of current techniques will provide the robust results required to enhance current elimination efforts.},

High quality census datasets, where available, are a unique opportunity to characterize maps by comparing them with truth. METHODS: We use census data from a bed-net mass-distribution campaign on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, conducted by the Bioko Island Malaria Elimination Program as a gold standard to evaluate LandScan (LS), WorldPop Constrained (WP-C) and WorldPop Unconstrained (WP-U), Gridded Population of the World (GPW), and the High-Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL). Each layer is compared to the gold-standard using statistical measures to evaluate distribution, error, and bias. We investigated how map choice affects burden estimates from a malaria prevalence model. RESULTS: Specific population layers were able to match the gold-standard distribution at different population densities. LandScan was able to most accurately capture highly urban distribution, HRSL and WP-C matched best at all other lower population densities. GPW and WP-U performed poorly everywhere. Correctly capturing empty pixels is key, and smaller pixel sizes (100 m vs 1 km) improve this. Normalizing areas based on known district populations increased performance. The use of differing population layers in a malaria model showed a disparity in results around transition points between endemicity levels. DISCUSSION: The metrics in this paper, some of them novel in this context, characterize how these population maps differ from the gold standard census and from each other. We show that the metrics help understand the performance of a population map within a malaria model. The closest match to the census data would combine LandScan within urban areas and the HRSL for rural areas. Researchers should prefer particular maps if health calculations have a strong dependency on knowing where people are not, or if it is important to categorize variation in density within a city.},

	abstract = {A model for the human immune response to the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is used to analyse the dynamics of an infection within an individual patient. Previous models either looked at competition between two parasite genotypes or at one parasite clone and the immune response to it. This model describes the course of an infection caused by the blood stages of two parasite genotypes differing in reproductive rate and in the immune response they elicit. The interactions between the genotypes can be interpreted as exploitative competition for red blood cells. Interactions between omnipotent immune cells and parasites resemble a predator-prey relation. In analysing these kinds of models, classical theoretical ecology usually deals with long-term behaviours, i.e. looks for equilibria and conditions for coexistence. However, especially in endemic regions with ongoing transmission, an equilibrium state of infections is unlikely. When reinfections with another parasite genotype were considered, the short-term dynamics of the infection changed dramatically, depending on which genotype was first, when the second one appeared, and what kind of immune response was elicited. If the slow development of immunity to malaria really is due to its genotype specificity, the effects of superinfections will be of great importance.},

The model simulates the hydrological and climatological determinants of malaria transmission mechanistically and at high spatialand temporal resolution, and is valid for semi-arid, desert fringe environments where the mosquito Anopheles gambiae s.l. is the dominant malaria vector. This includes much of the most malarious parts of Africa such as the Sahel. The model is validated with several years of field data collected from Banizoumbou village in southwestern Niger. Simulations of the 2005 and 2006 rain seasons in Banizoumbou using measured meteorological data successfully reproduce the observed interannual variability in malaria vector mosquito abundance. The distributed hydrology model operates at high spatial and temporal resolution, and incorporates remotely-sensed data for land cover and topography to simulate the formation and persistence of the small, temporary pools that constitute the breeding habitat of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes. An agent-based mosquito population model is coupled to the distributed hydrology model, with aquatic stage and adult stage components. Aquatic stage mosquitoes are allowed to breed in any surface water, but the developing eggs, larvae and pupae die if the pool dries. The model structure maintains the spatial relationships of breeding pools, mosquitoes, and human habitation. For each individual adult mosquito, the model tracks the attributes relevant to population dynamics and malaria transmission, which are updated as mosquitoes interact with their environment, humans, and animals.},

	abstract = {Public health interventions require evidence-based decision-making to maximize impact. Spatial decision support systems (SDSS) are designed to collect, store, process and analyze data to generate knowledge and inform decisions. This paper discusses how the use of a SDSS, the Campaign Information Management System (CIMS), to support malaria control operations on Bioko Island has impacted key process indicators of indoor residual spraying (IRS): coverage, operational efficiency and productivity. We used data from the last five annual IRS rounds (2017 to 2021) to estimate these indicators. IRS coverage was calculated as the percentage of houses sprayed per unit area, represented by 100x100 m map-sectors. Optimal coverage was defined as between 80\% and 85\%, and under and overspraying as coverage below 80\% and above 85\%, respectively. Operational efficiency was defined as the fraction of map-sectors that achieved optimal coverage. Daily productivity was expressed as the number of houses sprayed per sprayer per day (h/s/d). These indicators were compared across the five rounds. Overall IRS coverage (i.e. percent of total houses sprayed against the overall denominator by round) was highest in 2017 (80.2\%), yet this round showed the largest proportion of oversprayed map-sectors (36.0\%). Conversely, despite producing a lower overall coverage (77.5\%), the 2021 round showed the highest operational efficiency (37.7\%) and the lowest proportion of oversprayed map-sectors (18.7\%). In 2021, higher operational efficiency was also accompanied by marginally higher productivity. Productivity ranged from 3.3 h/s/d in 2020 to 3.9 h/s/d in 2021 (median 3.6 h/s/d). Our findings showed that the novel approach to data collection and processing proposed by the CIMS has significantly improved the operational efficiency of IRS on Bioko. High spatial granularity during planning and deployment together with closer follow-up of field teams using real-time data supported more homogeneous delivery of optimal coverage while sustaining high productivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria elimination is the goal for Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. Intensive interventions implemented since 2004 have reduced prevalence, but progress has stalled in recent years. A challenge for elimination has been malaria infections in residents acquired during travel to mainland Equatorial Guinea. The present article quantifies how off-island contributes to remaining malaria prevalence on Bioko Island, and investigates the potential role of a pre-erythrocytic vaccine in making further progress towards elimination. METHODS: Malaria transmission on Bioko Island was simulated using a model calibrated based on data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) from 2015 to 2018, including detailed travel histories and malaria positivity by rapid-diagnostic tests (RDTs), as well as geospatial estimates of malaria prevalence. Mosquito population density was adjusted to fit local transmission, conditional on importation rates under current levels of control and within-island mobility. The simulations were then used to evaluate the impact of two pre-erythrocytic vaccine distribution strategies: mass treat and vaccinate, and prophylactic vaccination for off-island travellers. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was performed through an ensemble of simulations fit to the Bayesian joint posterior probability distribution of the geospatial prevalence estimates. RESULTS: The simulations suggest that in Malabo, an urban city containing 80\% of the population, there are some pockets of residual transmission, but a large proportion of infections are acquired off-island by travellers to the mainland. Outside of Malabo, prevalence was mainly attributable to local transmission. The uncertainty in the local transmission vs. importation is lowest within Malabo and highest outside. Using a pre-erythrocytic vaccine to protect travellers would have larger benefits than using the vaccine to protect residents of Bioko Island from local transmission. In simulations, mass treatment and vaccination had short-lived benefits, as malaria prevalence returned to current levels as the vaccine's efficacy waned. Prophylactic vaccination of travellers resulted in longer-lasting reductions in prevalence. These projections were robust to underlying uncertainty in prevalence estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The modelled outcomes suggest that the volume of malaria cases imported from the mainland is a partial driver of continued endemic malaria on Bioko Island, and that continued elimination efforts on must account for human travel activity.},

	abstract = {Mosquitoes are important vectors for pathogens that infect humans and other vertebrate animals. Some aspects of adult mosquito behavior and mosquito ecology play an important role in determining the capacity of vector populations to transmit pathogens. Here, we re-examine factors affecting the transmission of pathogens by mosquitoes using a new approach. Unlike most previous models, this framework considers the behavioral states and state transitions of adult mosquitoes through a sequence of activity bouts. We developed a new framework for individual-based simulation models called MBITES (Mosquito Bout-based and Individual-based Transmission Ecology Simulator). In MBITES, it is possible to build models that simulate the behavior and ecology of adult mosquitoes in exquisite detail on complex resource landscapes generated by spatial point processes. We also developed an ordinary differential equation model which is the Kolmogorov forward equations for models developed in MBITES under a specific set of simplifying assumptions. While mosquito infection and pathogen development are one possible part of a mosquito's state, that is not our main focus. Using extensive simulation using some models developed in MBITES, we show that vectorial capacity can be understood as an emergent property of simple behavioral algorithms interacting with complex resource landscapes, and that relative density or sparsity of resources and the need to search can have profound consequences for mosquito populations' capacity to transmit pathogens.},

Similarly, a strong economic case is needed for the very long-term financial support that is essential for elimination. Another cross-cutting priority is the development of improved measures of intensity of transmission, especially at low and nonrandom levels. Because sustained malaria elimination is dependent on a functioning health system, a further key cross-cutting research question is to determine how inputs for malaria can strengthen health systems, information systems, and overall health outcomes. Implementation of elimination programs must also be accompanied by capacity building and training to allow the assessment of the impact of new combinations of interventions, new roles for different individuals, and the operational research that is needed to facilitate program expansion. Finally, because community engagement, knowledge management, communication, political, and multisectoral support are critical but poorly understood success factors for malaria elimination, integrated research into these issues is vital.},

The research needs for these areas will be to sustain and perhaps improve the effectiveness of currently available tools. For other low-to-moderate transmission regions, notably areas where the vectors exhibit behaviours such as outdoor feeding and resting that are not well targeted by current strategies, new interventions that target predictable features of the biology/ecologies of the local vectors will be required. To achieve elimination in areas where high levels of transmission are sustained by very efficient vector species, radically new interventions that significantly reduce the vectorial capacity of wild populations will be needed.

The capacity to assess trends and respond without delay will need to be developed, so that surveillance itself becomes an intervention. Research is also needed to develop sensitive field tests that can detect low levels of parasitaemia, together with strategies for their implementation. Other areas to explore include the rigorous evaluation of the utility of more detailed maps of disease and infection incidence and prevalence, the development of new maps to inform programmatic responses and the use of surveillance technologies based on cell phone or real-time internet Web-based reporting. Because any new strategies for monitoring and evaluation and surveillance for eradication have major implications for program implementation, research is also needed to test systems of delivery for acceptability, feasibility, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and community engagement.

	abstract = {Many of malaria's signs and symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other febrile diseases. Detection of the presence of Plasmodium parasites is essential, therefore, to guide case management. Improved diagnostic tools are required to enable targeted treatment of infected individuals. In addition, field-ready diagnostic tools for mass screening and surveillance that can detect asymptomatic infections of very low parasite densities are needed to monitor transmission reduction and ensure elimination. Antibody-based tests for infection and novel methods based on biomarkers need further development and validation, as do methods for the detection and treatment of Plasmodium vivax. Current rapid diagnostic tests targeting P. vivax are generally less effective than those targeting Plasmodium falciparum. Moreover, because current drugs for radical cure may cause serious side effects in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, more information is needed on the distribution of G6PD-deficiency variants as well as tests to identify at-risk individuals. Finally, in an environment of very low or absent malaria transmission, sustaining interest in elimination and maintaining resources will become increasingly important. Thus, research is required into the context in which malaria diagnostic tests are used, into diagnostics for other febrile diseases, and into the integration of these tests into health systems.},

This has led to conflicting speculations about the likely impact of malaria control interventions. We propose a quantitative framework to reconcile the various apparently contradictory observations relating morbidity and mortality rates to malaria transmission. Our model considers two sub-categories of severe malaria episodes. These comprise episodes with extremely high parasite densities in hosts with little previous exposure, and acute malaria episodes accompanied by co-morbidity or other risk factors enhancing susceptibility. In addition to direct malaria mortality from severe malaria episodes, the model also considers the enhanced risk of indirect mortality following acute episodes accompanied by co-morbidity after the parasites have been cleared. We fit this model to summaries of field data from endemic areas of Africa, and show that it can account for the observed age- and exposure-specific patterns of pediatric severe malaria and malaria-associated mortality in children. This model will allow us to make predictions of the long-term impact of potential malaria interventions. Predictions for children will be more reliable than those for older people because there is a paucity of epidemiologic studies of adults and adolescents.},

The model reproduces the shifts in age distribution of clinical episodes associated with variation in transmission intensity, and in keeping with the data, predicts a slightly higher lifetime number of episodes in the mesoendemic village of Ndiop than in the holoendemic village of Dielmo. This model provides a parsimonious explanation of counter-intuitive relationships between the overall incidence of clinical malaria and transmission intensity. In contrast to the theory of endemic stability, recently proposed to apply to P. falciparum, it does not assume any intrinsic age dependence in the outcome of infection.

Current attempts to develop malaria vaccines are primarily focused on Plasmodium falciparum and are directed towards reducing morbidity and mortality. Continued support for these efforts is essential, but if malaria vaccines are to be used as part of a repertoire of tools for elimination or eradication of malaria, they will need to have an impact on malaria transmission. We introduce the concept of “vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission” (VIMT), which includes not only “classical” transmission-blocking vaccines that target the sexual and mosquito stages but also pre-erythrocytic and asexual stage vaccines that have an effect on transmission. VIMT may also include vaccines that target the vector to disrupt parasite development in the mosquito. Importantly, if eradication is to be achieved, malaria vaccine development efforts will need to target other malaria parasite species, especially Plasmodium vivax, where novel therapeutic vaccines against hypnozoites or preventive vaccines with effect against multiple stages could have enormous impact. A target product profile (TPP) for VIMT is proposed and a research agenda to address current knowledge gaps and develop tools necessary for design and development of VIMT is presented.},

This interpretation is challenged by mathematical models that demonstrate that the long period required to develop immunity to malaria permits a high risk (or low average age) of infection even when parasite transmissibility is low. Patterns of seroconversion to five antigenically distinct isolates of P. falciparum in a highly malarious area of Papua New Guinea indicate that each is only mildly transmissible and that malaria, as a construct of several such independently transmitted strains, has a basic reproductive rate (or transmissibility) that is an order of magnitude lower than other estimates.},

Here we present a kinetic model of mosquito foraging for aquatic habitats and vertebrate hosts that allows estimation of malaria transmission intensity by defining the availability of these resources as the rate at which individual mosquitoes encounter and use them. The model captures historically observed responses of malaria transmission to environmental change, highlights important gaps in current understanding of vector ecology, and suggests convenient solutions. Resource availability is an intuitive concept that provides an adaptable framework for models of mosquito population dynamics, gene flow, and pathogen transmission that can be conveniently parameterized with direct field measurements. Furthermore, the model presented predicts that drastic reductions of malaria transmission are possible with environmental management and elucidates an ecologic basis for previous successes of integrated malaria control in Africa before the advent of DDT or chloroquine. Environmental management for malaria control requires specialist skills that are currently lacking in sub-Saharan Africa where they are needed most. Infrastructure and human capacity building in clinical, public health, and environmental disciplines should therefore be prioritized so that growing financial support for tackling malaria can be translated into truly integrated control programs.},

Our model indicates that although both IRS (with DDT) and ITNs provide personal protection, humans with only ITNs are better protected than those with only IRS, and suggests that high coverage of IRS with bendiocarb may interrupt transmission, as can simultaneous high coverage of ITNs and IRS with DDT. When adding a second vector-control intervention, it is more effective to cover the unprotected population first.

This simplification has facilitated insightful analyses but has substantial limitations for evaluating control measures in the field. Here we show that mosquito dispersal can confound conventional approaches to evaluating malaria vector-control interventions, and explore this association with a model of two villages between which mosquito subpopulation exchange occurs. Exchange of mosquitoes between such subpopulations can readily explain the discrepancy between experimental efficacy measurements for insecticide-treated nets and their much lower apparent effectiveness when in use. Our results indicate that current approaches to assessing malaria interventions that confer community-level protection may be severely compromised by mosquito dispersal in many endemic settings. The true effectiveness of many vector-control methods may be much greater than previously appreciated and the application of such interventions should be consolidated into larger contiguous spatial units so that more effective local suppression of malaria can be achieved. Spatially explicit modelling formats that consider vector dispersal as a determinant of malaria transmission and control are needed urgently for rational planning and evaluation of efforts to roll back malaria.},

This paper presents an object-oriented design for individual-based modelling of Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission. Two kinds of objects, human and mosquito, that exhibit variability among individuals for parameters such as recovery and survival rates are defined. The model tracks the dynamics of human hosts and adult female mosquitoes individually. Immunity, modelled as a function of exposure history, is represented by reduced susceptibility and increased recovery rate. The model was calibrated using epidemiological data collected at 30 sites along the coast of Kenya. The sites were grouped into low, intermediate and high transmission based on mean daily human-biting rates. Simulation results show that malaria transmission was stable even in low transmission areas where the human-biting rate is approximately 0.5 bite per day. The model was used to examine the effect of infection control programmes that aim at interrupting transmission by reducing human-vector contact rates and implementing active case detection and drug treatment of infections. With this intervention, local elimination of malaria is likely with a probability of extinction of approximately 0.8 in low transmission areas. However, a small amount of immigration ({\textgreater} 0.3\%) by infected people into the community could prevent local extinction of the parasite. In intermediate and high transmission areas, reduction in prevalence is short-lived and the probability of local elimination is low, even at high coverage levels of the intervention.},

	abstract = {Although the spread of drug resistance and the influence of climate change on malaria are most often considered separately, these factors have the potential to interact through altered levels of transmission intensity. The influence of transmission intensity on the evolution of drug resistance has been addressed in theoretical studies from a population genetics' perspective; less is known however on how epidemiological dynamics at the population level modulates this influence. We ask from a theoretical perspective, whether population dynamics can explain non-trivial, non-monotonic, patterns of treatment failure with transmission intensity, and, if so, under what conditions. We then address the implications of warmer temperatures in an East African highland, where, as in other similar regions at the altitudinal edge of malaria's distribution, there has been a pronounced increase of cases from the 1970s to the 1990s. Our theoretical analyses, with a transmission model that includes different levels of immunity, demonstrate that an increase in transmission beyond a threshold can lead to a decrease in drug resistance, as previously shown, but that a second threshold may occur and lead to the re-establishment of drug resistance. Estimates of the increase in transmission intensity from the 1970s to the 1990s for the Kenyan time series, obtained by fitting the two-stage version of the model with an explicit representation of vector dynamics, suggest that warmer temperatures are likely to have moved the system towards the first threshold, and in so doing, to have promoted the faster spread of drug resistance. Climate change and drug resistance can interact and need not be considered as alternative explanations for trends in disease incidence in this region. Non-monotonic patterns of treatment failure with transmission intensity similar to those described as the 'valley phenomenon' for Uganda can result from epidemiological dynamics but under poorly understood assumptions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective malaria control has successfully reduced the malaria burden in many countries, but to eliminate malaria, these countries will need to further improve their control efforts. Here, a malaria control programme was critically evaluated in a very low-endemicity Thai-Myanmar border population, where early detection and prompt treatment have substantially reduced, though not ended, Plasmodium falciparum transmission, in part due to carriage of late-maturing gametocytes that remain post-treatment. To counter this effect, the WHO recommends the use of a single oral dose of primaquine along with an effective blood schizonticide. However, while the effectiveness of primaquine as a gametocidal agent is widely documented, the mismatch between primaquine's short half-life, the long-delay for gametocyte maturation and the proper timing of primaquine administration have not been studied. METHODS: Mathematical models were constructed to simulate 8-year surveillance data, between 1999 and 2006, of seven villages along the Thai-Myanmar border. A simple model was developed to consider primaquine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, gametocyte carriage, and infectivity. RESULTS: In these populations, transmission intensity is very low, so the P. falciparum parasite rate is strongly linked to imported malaria and to the fraction of cases not treated. Given a 3.6-day half-life of gametocyte, the estimated duration of infectiousness would be reduced by 10 days for every 10-fold reduction in initial gametocyte densities. Infectiousness from mature gametocytes would last two to four weeks and sustain some transmission, depending on the initial parasite densities, but the residual mature gametocytes could be eliminated by primaquine. Because of the short half-life of primaquine (approximately eight hours), it was immediately obvious that with early administration (within three days after an acute attack), primaquine would not be present when mature gametocytes emerged eight days after the appearance of asexual blood-stage parasites. A model of optimal timing suggests that primaquine follow-up approximately eight days after a clinical episode could further reduce the duration of infectiousness from two to four weeks down to a few days. The prospects of malaria elimination would be substantially improved by changing the timing of primaquine administration and combining this with effective detection and management of imported malaria cases. The value of using primaquine to reduce residual gametocyte densities and to reduce malaria transmission was considered in the context of a malaria transmission model; the added benefit of the primaquine follow-up treatment would be relatively large only if a high fraction of patients ({\textgreater}95\%) are initially treated with schizonticidal agents. CONCLUSION: Mathematical models have previously identified the long duration of P. falciparum asexual blood-stage infections as a critical point in maintaining malaria transmission, but infectiousness can persist for two to four weeks because of residual populations of mature gametocytes. Simulations from new models suggest that, in areas where a large fraction of malaria cases are treated, curing the asexual parasitaemia in a primary infection, and curing mature gametocyte infections with an eight-day follow-up treatment with primaquine have approximately the same proportional effects on reducing the infectious period. Changing the timing of primaquine administration would, in all likelihood, interrupt transmission in this area with very good health systems and with very low endemicity.},

We simulate the introduction of a new parasite genotype into a human population in which another genotype has reached equilibrium prevalence and compare the emergence and persistence of the novel recombinant forms under differing cross-reactivity relationships between the genotypes. Cross-reactivity between the parental (initial and introduced) genotypes reduces the frequency of appearance of recombinants within three years of introduction from 100\% to 14\%, and delays their appearance by more than a year, on average. Cross-reactivity between parental and recombinant genotypes reduces the frequency of appearance to 36\% and increases the probability of recombinant extinction following appearance from 0\% to 83\%. When a recombinant is cross-reactive with its parental types, its probability of extinction is influenced by cross-reactivity between the parental types in the opposite manner; that is, its probability of extinction after appearance decreases. Frequencies of P. falciparum outcrossing are mediated by frequencies of mixed-genotype infections in the host population, which are in turn mediated by the structure of cross-reactivity between parasite genotypes. The three leading hypotheses about how meiosis relates to oocyst production lead to quantitative, but no qualitative, differences in these results.},

We used observed age-structured patterns of disease to define a population structure of P. falciparum, where the latter contains several independently transmitted antigenic types or “strains” that each induce some degree of strain-specific antidisease immunity upon infection. Patterns of incidence of severe and mild disease may be explained by assuming that a majority of these strains are associated with mild disease and that although severe malarial anemia is a complication occurring in a certain proportion of early infections with “mild” parasites, cerebral malaria is caused by a few distinct highly virulent strains. Considerable variation in parasite virulence, as a major factor of disease severity in malaria, is made possible by the absence of competition between the various parasite strains, arising from weak shared immune responses. The theoretical framework presented in this paper can explain other epidemiological observations, such as the results of interventions with insecticide-impregnated bednets.},

The fact that some people are bitten more often than others has a large effect on the relationship between risk factors and prevalence of vector-borne diseases. Here we develop a mathematical framework that allows us to estimate the heterogeneity of infection rates from the relationship between rates of infectious bites and community prevalence. We apply this framework to a large, published data set that combines malaria measurements from more than 90 communities. We find strong evidence that heterogeneous biting or heterogeneous susceptibility to infection are important and pervasive factors determining the prevalence of infection: 20\% of people receive 80\% of all infections. We also find that individual infections last about six months on average, per infectious bite, and children who clear infections are not immune to new infections. The results have important implications for public health interventions: the success of malaria control will depend heavily on whether efforts are targeted at those who are most at risk of infection.},

In malaria eradication programmes this index is relevant to epidemiological assessment and to the modification of measures to interrupt transmission, since a mosquito's vectorial capacity and the malaria reproduction rate both vary as the square of the human blood index.There are serious difficulties in achieving representative sampling for this index and in interpreting the index obtained. These are discussed in some detail. In practice, the human blood index is often best estimated by applying the unweighted mean of a part-sample collected from human dwellings and one from other types of resting-place.Applying this calculation to the samples under review, it appears that DDT exerts a moderate, and dieldrin a more pronounced, impact on the human blood index of Anopheles gambiae and A. funestus; such an effect, indeed, may be general in house-visiting anophelines. Some 18 anopheline species are tentatively graded as having low, medium or high natural human blood indices. Regular and careful sampling, combined with recording of all relevant information, is recommended in view of the epidemiological and operational importance of the human blood index in assessment of eradication programmes.},

If R0 is greater than unity, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there exists a unique stable endemic equilibrium.

All the basic elements of the theory had fallen into place by the end of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP, 1955-1969) with the concept of vectorial capacity, methods for measuring key components of transmission by mosquitoes, and a quantitative theory of vector control. The Ross-Macdonald theory has since played a central role in development of research on mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and the development of strategies for mosquito-borne disease prevention.},

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report the results from such a study spanning 5 years in the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru where DENV infection was monitored serologically among approximately 2,400 members of a neighborhood-based cohort and through school-based absenteeism surveillance for active febrile illness among a subset of this cohort. At baseline, 80\% of the study population had DENV antibodies, seroprevalence increased with age, and significant geographic variation was observed, with neighborhood-specific age-adjusted rates ranging from 67.1 to 89.9\%. During the first 15 months, when DENV-1 and DENV-2 were co-circulating, population-based incidence rates ranged from 2-3 infections/100 person-years (p-years). The introduction of DENV-3 during the last half of 2001 was characterized by 3 distinct periods: amplification over at least 5-6 months, replacement of previously circulating serotypes, and epidemic transmission when incidence peaked at 89 infections/100 p-years. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Neighborhood-specific baseline seroprevalence rates were not predictive of geographic incidence patterns prior to the DENV-3 introduction, but were closely mirrored during the invasion of this serotype. Transmission varied geographically, with peak incidence occurring at different times among the 8 geographic zones in approximately 16 km(2) of the city. The lag from novel serotype introduction to epidemic transmission and knowledge of spatially explicit areas of elevated risk should be considered for more effective application of limited resources for dengue prevention.},

Susceptible humans can be infected when they are bitten by an infectious mosquito. They then progress through the exposed, infectious, and recovered classes, before reentering the susceptible class. Susceptible mosquitoes can become infected when they bite infectious or recovered humans, and once infected they move through the exposed and infectious classes. Both species follow a logistic population model, with humans having immigration and disease?induced death. We define a reproductive number, \$R\_0\$, for the number of secondary cases that one infected individual will cause through the duration of the infectious period. We find that the disease?free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when \$R\_0 1\$. We prove the existence of at least one endemic equilibrium point for all \$R\_0 {\textgreater} 1\$. In the absence of disease?induced death, we prove that the transcritical bifurcation at \$R\_0 =1\$ is supercritical (forward). Numerical simulations show that for larger values of the disease?induced death rate, a subcritical (backward) bifurcation is possible at \$R\_0=1\$.},

	abstract = {The key conclusions of several mathematical models of malaria are reviewed with emphasis on their relevance for control. The Ross-Macdonald model of malaria transmission has had major influence on malaria control. One of its main conclusions is that endemicity of malaria is most sensitive to changes in mosquito imago survival rate. Thus malaria can be controlled more efficiently with imagicides than with larvicides. An extension of this model shows that the amount of variability in transmission parameters strongly affects the outcome of control measures and that predictions of the outcome can be misleading. Models that describe the immune response and simulate vaccination programs suggest that one of the most important determinants of the outcome of a vaccine campaign is the duration of vaccine efficacy. Apparently malaria can be controlled only if the duration of efficacy is in the order of a human life-span. The models further predict that asexual stage vaccines are more efficient than transmission-blocking vaccines. Directions for further applications of mathematical models are discussed.},

	abstract = {Monitoring and evaluation are critically important to the scientific management of any parasite control programme. If a management action is prescribed, monitoring plays a pivotal role in assessing the effectiveness of implemented actions, identifying necessary adaptations for management and determining when management objectives are achieved. Here, we focus on the control of the vector-borne parasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, to show how mathematical models of parasite transmission can provide a scientific framework for supporting the optimal design of parasite control monitoring programmes by their ability to (1) enable the estimation of endpoint targets, (2) provide information on expected trends in infection due to interventions to allow rational evaluation of intervention effectiveness and calculation of the frequency of monitoring, (3) support the selection of indicators that permit reliable and statistically powerful measurement of the effects of interventions while minimizing costs and sampling intensity and (4) aid the interpretation of monitoring data for improving programme management and knowledge of the population dynamics of parasite control. The results also highlight how the use of a model-based monitoring framework will be vitally enhanced by adopting an adaptive management approach that acknowledges uncertainty and facilitates the use of monitoring data to learn about effective control, and which allows future decisions to be modified as we learn by doing. We conclude by emphasizing a pressing need to incorporate mathematical models coupled with changes to existing management systems in ongoing efforts to design and implement rational monitoring plans for evaluating filariasis and other parasitic disease control programmes.

	abstract = {There is a consensus among climatologists that our planet is experiencing a progressive rise in surface temperature due to the increased production of “greenhouse” gases. Some of the possible consequences of elevated temperature on malaria transmission are examined in the present review. A simple mathematical model is first used to examine the effect of temperature on the ability of Anopheles maculipennis to transmit vivax malaria. This indicates that small increases in temperature at low temperatures may increase the risk of transmission substantially. This is important, since vulnerable communities, poorly protected by health services, in areas of unstable or no malaria are likely to be at increased risk of future outbreaks. In contrast, areas of stable transmission may be little affected by rising temperature. It is thought that global warming will lead to coastal flooding, changes in precipitation and, indirectly, changes in land use. Just how these changes will effect transmission at a regional level requires an understanding of the ecology of local vectors, since environmental changes which favour malaria transmission in one vector species may reduce it in another. Methods for predicting future changes in malaria in different regions are discussed, highlighting the need for further research in this area. Most importantly, there is a need for researchers to validate the accuracy of the models used for predicting malaria and to confirm the assumptions on which the models are based.},

One of the potential health consequences is a change in distribution patterns of vector-borne diseases. In tropical countries, such diseases are a major cause of illness and death.

Climatic conditions, and temperature in particular, directly influence mosquito development, feeding-frequency and longevity of the mosquito, as well as the time in which the parasite develops inside the mosquito. Other environmental factors such as vegetation and breeding sites are indirectly influenced by climate conditions. In order to assess the impact of an anthropogenic climate change on the transmission of malaria, an integrated assessment model has been developed. In this integrated model, the direct effects of a change in temperature and precipitation on the transmission potential of a mosquito population is assessed by means of the vectorial capacity. The effect of a human-induced climate change on human health is evaluated by assessing the change in malaria prevalence and disease burden. A sustainable development index, which is an aggregate of an environmental pressure indicator, a health indicator and a socio-economic development indicator is introduced and discussed. Such an index can be used to determine whether future projections are sustainable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade malaria intervention coverage has been scaled up across Africa. However, it remains unclear what overall reduction in transmission is achievable using currently available tools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed an individual-based simulation model for Plasmodium falciparum transmission in an African context incorporating the three major vector species (Anopheles gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis, and An. funestus) with parameters obtained by fitting to parasite prevalence data from 34 transmission settings across Africa. We incorporated the effect of the switch to artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) and increasing coverage of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) from the year 2000 onwards. We then explored the impact on transmission of continued roll-out of LLINs, additional rounds of indoor residual spraying (IRS), mass screening and treatment (MSAT), and a future RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in six representative settings with varying transmission intensity (as summarized by the annual entomological inoculation rate, EIR: 1 setting with low, 3 with moderate, and 2 with high EIRs), vector-species combinations, and patterns of seasonality. In all settings we considered a realistic target of 80\% coverage of interventions. In the low-transmission setting (EIR approximately 3 ibppy [infectious bites per person per year]), LLINs have the potential to reduce malaria transmission to low levels (90\%) or novel tools and/or substantial social improvements will be required, although considerable reductions in prevalence can be achieved with existing tools and realistic coverage levels. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions using current tools can result in major reductions in P. falciparum malaria transmission and the associated disease burden in Africa. Reduction to the 1\% parasite prevalence threshold is possible in low- to moderate-transmission settings when vectors are primarily endophilic (indoor-resting), provided a comprehensive and sustained intervention program is achieved through roll-out of interventions. In high-transmission settings and those in which vectors are mainly exophilic (outdoor-resting), additional new tools that target exophagic (outdoor-biting), exophilic, and partly zoophagic mosquitoes will be required.},

	abstract = {The paper investigates the global stability of a dengue epidemic model with saturation and bilinear incidence. The constant human recruitment rate and exponential natural death, as well as vector population with asymptotically constant population, are incorporated into the model. The model exhibits two equilibria, namely, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium. The stability of these two equilibria is controlled by the threshold number R-0. It is shown that if R-0 is less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and in such a case the endemic equilibrium does not exist; if R-0 is greater than one, then the disease persists and the unique endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.

The concept of the disability-adjusted life years is included to arrive at a single measure of the effect of anthropogenic climate change on the health impact of malaria. Assessment of the potential impact of global climate change on the incidence of malaria suggests a widespread increase of risk due to expansion of the areas suitable for malaria transmission. This predicted increase is most pronounced at the borders of endemic malaria areas and at higher altitudes within malarial areas. The incidence of infection is sensitive to climate changes in areas of Southeast Asia, South America, and parts of Africa where the disease is less endemic; in these regions the numbers of years of healthy life lost may increase significantly. However, the simulated changes in malaria risk must be interpreted on the basis of local environmental conditions, the effects of socioeconomic developments, and malaria control programs or capabilities.},

This rate is a known function of several epidemiological direct factors and is particularly sensitive to the survival rate and the sporogonic cycle of the vector. Although not yet fully quantifiable, relationships exist between direct factors responsible for the transmission of infection and certain meteorological and environmental indirect factors like air temperature, relative humidity, or importation of malaria parasites. The establishment of a two-stage monitoring system is suggested: the first stage would involve setting up a warning system based on the surveillance of the relevant indirect factors; at the appropriate time, this would trigger the second stage monitoring of the epidemiological direct factors having a definite bearing on the development of malaria outbreaks. It is recognized that the gain in reliability of the proposed approach depends largely on the progress still to be achieved in the quantification of the complex system of relations connecting the main direct factors with single or combined indirect factors. It is also noted that the proposed monitoring system should, in due course, provide the decision-makers with the epidemiological information required for the selection and implementation of intervention measures designed to prevent epidemic resurgences.},

	abstract = {Malaria has long been a scourge to humans. The exceptionally high mortality in some regions has led to strong selection for resistance, even at the cost of increased risk of potentially fatal red blood cell deformities in some offspring. In particular, genes that confers resistance to malaria when they appear in heterozygous individuals are known to lead to sickle-cell anemia, or other blood diseases, when they appear in homozygous form. Thus, there is balancing selection against the evolution of resistance, with the strength of that selection dependent upon malaria prevalence. Over longer time scales, the increased frequency of resistance in a population might be expected to decrease the frequency of malaria and reduce selection for resistance. However, possession of the sickle-cell gene leads to longer-lasting parasitaemia in heterozygote individuals, and therefore the presence of resistance may actually increase infection prevalence. In this paper, we explore the interplay among these processes, operating over very different time scales. In particular, we show that on the fast time scale of malarial dynamics, the disease level reaches an equilibrium; on the slower, evolutionary time scale, this equilibrium tracks gene frequency. We analyze the slow time scale dynamics to investigate the impact of malaria on the evolution of resistance.},

This information has resulted in the development of molecular methods to type parasite diversity in the field. Consequently, we are now in a position to describe the population genetics and dynamics of P. falciparum. The limited number of field studies that have been conducted to date have revealed an extraordinary degree of genetic diversity in natural parasite populations. Heterozygous recombination which occurs during meiosis appears to be one mechanism for generating genetic diversity. The rate at which such recombination occurs in natural parasite populations defines the genetic structure of the parasite population and can influence the ability of the parasite to respond to selection pressure. The high frequency of single genotype infections and the female-biased gametocyte sex ratios found in hyperendemic malaria areas suggest that self-fertilization occurs frequently. Population-wide surveys of allele frequencies in endemic areas have, however, shown no evidence of linkage disequilibrium and are consistent with a panmictic population structure. We argue that these studies have only sampled symptomatic infections, within which rare or recombinant genotypes may be disproportionately represented. They also take no account of the spatial structure of P. falciparum populations. Systematic investigations of the amount of heterozygosity in small areas as part of population-wide surveys are required to define the genetic structure of P. falciparum populations. Population dynamic studies which consider genetic heterogeneity of P. falciparum have shown fluctuations of different serotypes in space and time. The host immune response appears to play an important role in generating these dynamics. Integrated field and laboratory studies, which consider the interaction between population genetics and dynamics, will be necessary to describe the population biology of P. falciparum.},

	abstract = {As the resistance of the malaria parasite to antimalarial drugs continues to increase, as does that of the malarial mosquito to insecticides, the efficacy of efforts to control malaria in many tropical countries is diminishing. This trend, together with the projected consequences of climate change, may prove to exacerbate substantially the significance of malaria in the coming decades. In this article we introduce the use of an evolutionary modeling approach to simulate the adaptation of mosquitoes and parasites to the available pesticides and drugs. By coupling genetic algorithms with a dynamic malaria-epidemiological model, we derive a complex adaptive system capable of simulating adapting and evolving processes within both the mosquito and the parasite populations. This approach is used to analyze malaria management strategies appropriate to regions of higher and lower degrees of endemicity. The results suggest that adequate use of insecticides and drugs may reduce the occurrence of malaria in regions of low endemicity, although increased efforts would be necessary in the event of a climate change. However, our model indicates that in regions of high endemicity the use of insecticides and drugs may lead to an increase in incidence due to enhanced resistance development. Projected climate change, on the other hand, may lead to a limited reduction of the occurrence of malaria due to the presence of a higher percentage of immune persons in the older age class.},

	abstract = {The impact of climate change on human health has received increasing attention in recent years, with potential impacts due to vector-borne diseases only now beginning to be understood. As the most severe vector-borne disease, with one million deaths globally in 2006, malaria is thought most likely to be affected by changes in climate variables due to the sensitivity of its transmission dynamics to environmental conditions. While considerable research has been carried out using statistical models to better assess the relationship between changes in environmental variables and malaria incidence, less progress has been made on developing process-based climate-driven mathematical models with greater explanatory power. Here, we develop a simple model of malaria transmission linked to climate which permits useful insights into the sensitivity of disease transmission to changes in rainfall and temperature variables. Both the impact of changes in the mean values of these key external variables and importantly temporal variation in these values are explored. We show that the development and analysis of such dynamic climate-driven transmission models will be crucial to understanding the rate at which P. falciparum and P. vivax may either infect, expand into or go extinct in populations as local environmental conditions change. Malaria becomes endemic in a population when the basic reproduction number R0 is greater than unity and we identify an optimum climate-driven transmission window for the disease, thus providing a useful indicator for determing how transmission risk may change as climate changes. Overall, our results indicate that considerable work is required to better understand ways in which global malaria incidence and distribution may alter with climate change. In particular, we show that the roles of seasonality, stochasticity and variability in environmental variables, as well as ultimately anthropogenic effects, require further study. The work presented here offers a theoretical framework upon which this future research may be developed.},

HYDREMATS is forced by observed rainfall, followed by a rainfall prediction based on the seasonal mean rainfall for a period two or four weeks into the future. RESULTS: Predictions made using this method provided reasonable estimates of mosquito populations and vectorial capacity, two to four weeks in advance. The predictions were significantly improved compared to those made when HYDREMATS was forced with seasonal mean rainfall alone.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) is a commonly reported index of malaria transmission intensity. PfPR rises after birth to a plateau before declining in older children and adults. Studies of populations with different age ranges generally report average PfPR, so age is an important source of heterogeneity in reported PfPR data. This confounds simple comparisons of PfPR surveys conducted at different times or places. METHODS: Several algorithms for standardizing PfPR were developed using 21 studies that stratify in detail PfPR by age. An additional 121 studies were found that recorded PfPR from the same population over at least two different age ranges; these paired estimates were used to evaluate these algorithms. The best algorithm was judged to be the one that described most of the variance when converting the PfPR pairs from one age-range to another. RESULTS: The analysis suggests that the relationship between PfPR and age is predictable across the observed range of malaria endemicity. PfPR reaches a peak after about two years and remains fairly constant in older children until age ten before declining throughout adolescence and adulthood. The PfPR pairs were poorly correlated; using one to predict the other would explain only 5\% of the total variance. By contrast, the PfPR predicted by the best algorithm explained 72\% of the variance. CONCLUSION: The PfPR in older children is useful for standardization because it has good biological, epidemiological and statistical properties. It is also historically consistent with the classical categories of hypoendemic, mesoendemic and hyperendemic malaria. This algorithm provides a reliable method for standardizing PfPR for the purposes of comparing studies and mapping malaria endemicity. The scripts for doing so are freely available to all.},

	abstract = {Achieving a theoretical foundation for malaria elimination will require a detailed understanding of the quantitative relationships between patient treatment-seeking behavior, treatment coverage, and the effects of curative therapies that also block Plasmodium parasite transmission to mosquito vectors. Here, we report a mechanistic, within-host mathematical model that uses pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data to simulate the effects of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) on Plasmodium falciparum transmission. To contextualize this model, we created a set of global maps of the fold reductions that would be necessary to reduce the malaria R C (i.e. its basic reproductive number under control) to below 1 and thus interrupt transmission. This modeling was applied to low-transmission settings, defined as having a R 0{\textless}10 based on 2010 data. Our modeling predicts that treating 93-98\% of symptomatic infections with an ACT within five days of fever onset would interrupt malaria transmission for ∼91\% of the at-risk population of Southeast Asia and ∼74\% of the global at-risk population, and lead these populations towards malaria elimination. This level of treatment coverage corresponds to an estimated 81-85\% of all infected individuals in these settings. At this coverage level with ACTs, the addition of the gametocytocidal agent primaquine affords no major gains in transmission reduction. Indeed, we estimate that it would require switching ∼180 people from ACTs to ACTs plus primaquine to achieve the same transmission reduction as switching a single individual from untreated to treated with ACTs. Our model thus predicts that the addition of gametocytocidal drugs to treatment regimens provides very small population-wide benefits and that the focus of control efforts in Southeast Asia should be on increasing prompt ACT coverage. Prospects for elimination in much of Sub-Saharan Africa appear far less favorable currently, due to high rates of infection and less frequent and less rapid treatment.},

Such cross-reactive immunological responses thereby induce between-strain competition within the pathogen population. However, in some cases such as dengue virus, evidence suggests that cross-reactive antibodies act to enhance rather than restrict the severity of a subsequent infection by another strain. This cooperative mechanism is thought to explain why pre-existing immunity to dengue virus is an important risk factor for the development of severe disease (i.e., dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever). In this paper, we explore the effect of antibody-dependent enhancement on the transmission dynamics of multistrain pathogen populations. We show that enhancement frequently may generate complex and persistent cyclical or chaotic epidemic behavior. Furthermore, enhancement acts to permit the coexistence of all strains where in its absence only one or a subset would persist.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in Plasmodium falciparum that confer resistance to first-line antimalarial drugs have spread throughout the world from a few independent foci, all located in areas that were likely characterized by low or unstable malaria transmission. One of the striking differences between areas of low or unstable malaria transmission and hyperendemic areas is the difference in the size of the population of immune individuals. However, epidemiological models of malaria transmission have generally ignored the role of immune individuals in transmission, assuming that they do not affect the fitness of the parasite. This model reconsiders the role of immunity in the dynamics of malaria transmission and its impact on the evolution of antimalarial drug resistance under the assumption that immune individuals are infectious. METHODS: The model is constructed as a two-stage susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model of malaria transmission that assumes that individuals build up clinical immunity over a period of years. This immunity reduces the frequency and severity of clinical symptoms, and thus their use of drugs. It also reduces an individual's level of infectiousness, but does not impact the likelihood of becoming infected. RESULTS: Simulations found that with the introduction of resistance into a population, clinical immunity can significantly alter the fitness of the resistant parasite, and thereby impact the ability of the resistant parasite to spread from an initial host by reducing the effective reproductive number of the resistant parasite as transmission intensity increases. At high transmission levels, despite a higher basic reproductive number, R0, the effective reproductive number of the resistant parasite may fall below the reproductive number of the sensitive parasite. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that high-levels of clinical immunity create a natural ecological refuge for drug-sensitive parasites. This provides an epidemiological rationale for historical patterns of resistance emergence and suggests that future outbreaks of resistance are more likely to occur in low- or unstable-transmission settings. This finding has implications for the design of drug policies and the formulation of malaria control strategies, especially those that lower malaria transmission intensity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inclusion of multiple immunogens to target a single organism is a strategy being pursued for many experimental vaccines, especially where it is difficult to generate a strongly protective response from a single immunogen. Although there are many human vaccines that contain multiple defined immunogens, in almost every case each component targets a different pathogen. As a consequence, there is little practical experience for deciding where the increased complexity of vaccines with multiple defined immunogens vaccines targeting single pathogens will be justifiable. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A mathematical model, with immunogenicity parameters derived from a database of human responses to established vaccines, was used to predict the increase in the efficacy and the proportion of the population protected resulting from addition of further immunogens. The gains depended on the relative protection and the range of responses in the population to each immunogen and also to the correlation of the responses between immunogens. In most scenarios modeled, the gain in overall efficacy obtained by adding more immunogens was comparable to gains obtained from a single immunogen through the use of better formulations or adjuvants. Multi-component single target vaccines were more effective at decreasing the proportion of poor responders than increasing the overall efficacy of the vaccine in a population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Inclusion of limited number of antigens in a vaccine aimed at targeting a single organism will increase efficacy, but the gains are relatively modest and for a practical vaccine there are constraints that are likely to limit multi-component single target vaccines to a small number of key antigens. The model predicts that this type of vaccine will be most useful where the critical issue is the reduction in proportion of poor responders.},

No significant feeding upon host species other than cattle or humans was detected. Even though An. gambiae s.l. in The Gambia were mostly An. gambiae s.s., they were 77 times more likely to choose cattle over humans than An. gambiae s.s. in Tanzania. The model accurately predicted cattle blood indices for the An. arabiensis population in Tanzania (predicted = 0.99 +/- 0.21 x observed + 0.00 +/- 0.10; r2 = 0.66). The potential effect of increased cattle abundance upon malaria transmission intensity was simulated using fitted relative availability parameters and assuming vector emergence rate, feeding cycle length and survivorship were unaffected. The model predicted that increased cattle populations would not affect malaria transmission in Tanzania but could drastically reduce transmission in The Gambia or where An. arabiensis is the dominant vector. We define the availability of a host as the rate at which a typical individual host-seeking vector encounters and feeds upon that host in a single feeding cycle. Mathematical models based on this definition also represent promising tools for quantifying the dependence of vector longevity, feeding cycle length and dispersal upon host availability.},

By conducting a sensitivity analysis of the model we have defined the parameter limits which produce chronic and recrudescing infections. We explore 3 switching mechanisms: ordered, random and uncoupled switching. We show that if var genes switch on and off independently at variable rates through the repertoire a chronic clinical infection is predicted. The fastest switching-on rate that produces a chronic infection is 0.03\% per generation. The model predicts that non-variant specific immunity plays an important role in reducing disease severity. This work illustrates the complex relationship between the malaria parasite and its host and shows that var gene switching at rates substantially slower than 2\% are essential for parasite survival.},

We contrast this dispersal with the relatively unchanged distribution of Anopheles gambiae and examine possible future movements of this malaria vector. We use a comprehensive database of international ship and aircraft traffic movements, combined with climatic information, to remap the global transportation network in terms of disease vector suitability and accessibility. The expansion of the range of Ae. albopictus proved to be surprisingly predictable using this combination of climate and traffic data. Traffic volumes were more than twice as high on shipping routes running from the historical distribution of Ae. albopictus to ports where it has established in comparison with routes to climatically similar ports where it has yet to invade. In contrast, An. gambiae has rarely spread from Africa, which we suggest is partly due to the low volume of sea traffic from the continent and, until very recently, a European destination for most flights.},

History is invaluable as a pointer to future risks, but direct extrapolation is no longer possible because the climate is changing. Researchers are therefore embracing computer simulation models and global change scenarios to explore the risks. Credible ranking of the extent to which different vector-borne diseases will be affected awaits a rigorous analysis. Adaptation to the changes is threatened by the ongoing loss of drugs and pesticides due to the selection of resistant strains of pathogens and vectors. The vulnerability of communities to the changes in impacts depends on their adaptive capacity, which requires both appropriate technology and responsive public health systems. The availability of resources in turn depends on social stability, economic wealth, and priority allocation of resources to public health.},

	abstract = {Periodicity in malaria transmission has generally been ascribed to seasonal fluctuations in mosquito population density or spatial heterogeneity with periodic migration. In this paper we demonstrate that simple models of strain heterogeneity can generate periodic behaviour as a consequence of the interaction between parasite strains and host immunological defences. As the degree of cross-immunity between strains increases, the system moves from a regime of independent strain transmission and coexistence, through increasingly coupled behaviour, to the displacement of the strain of lower transmissibility by the strain with a higher basic reproductive rate (R(0)). Cross-immunity thus serves both to bring the strains into competition, and also to couple the dynamics. We find analytical and numerical results on strain coexistence to show how the range of possible outcomes may be read as an effect of the tension between these two effects of cross-protection.},

The impact is expressed as the product of the degree of reduction of the expectation of infective life (termed the longevity factor of impact) and that of the expectation of life (the density factor). To compute the factors from the proportion parous it is necessary to know also the mean difference in age between the nulliparous and the youngest parous females in the sample, and the sporogonic period of the parasite.Graphs are presented to enable the field worker, who has observed these parameters, to read off from his data the proportion surviving one day, the expectation of infective life and the expectation of life. Examples from the field are used to illustrate the manner of computing the direct insecticidal impact with the aid of the graphs. It is emphasized that this method can only measure the relative impact on vectorial capacity, and will not show whether the actual level of vectorial capacity is such that a malaria reproduction rate of {\textless}1 is indicated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The time necessary for malaria parasite to re-appear in the blood following treatment (re-infection time) is an indirect method for evaluating the immune defences operating against pre-erythrocytic and early erythrocytic malaria stages. Few longitudinal data are available in populations in whom malaria transmission level had also been measured. METHODS: One hundred and ten individuals from the village of Ndiop (Senegal), aged between one and 72 years, were cured of malaria by quinine (25 mg/day oral Quinimax in three equal daily doses, for seven days). Thereafter, thick blood films were examined to detect the reappearance of Plasmodium falciparum every week, for 11 weeks after treatment. Malaria transmission was simultaneously measured weekly by night collection of biting mosquitoes. RESULTS: Malaria transmission was on average 15.3 infective bites per person during the 77 days follow up. The median reappearance time for the whole study population was 46.8 days, whereas individuals would have received an average one infective bite every 5 days. At the end of the follow-up, after 77 days, 103 of the 110 individuals (93.6\%; CI 95\% [89.0-98.2]) had been re-infected with P. falciparum. The median reappearance time ('re-positivation') was longer in subjects with patent parasitaemia at enrolment than in parasitologically-negative individuals (58 days vs. 45.9; p = 0.03) and in adults {\textgreater} 30 years than in younger subjects (58.6 days vs. 42.7; p = 0.0002). In a multivariate Cox PH model controlling for the sickle cell trait, G6PD deficiency and the type of habitat, the presence of parasitaemia at enrolment and age {\textgreater}/= 30 years were independently predictive of a reduced risk of re-infection (PH = 0.5 [95\% CI: 0.3-0.9] and 0.4; [95\% CI: 0.2-0.6] respectively). CONCLUSION: Results indicate the existence of a substantial resistance to sporozoites inoculations, but which was ultimately overcome in almost every individual after 2 1/2 months of natural challenges. Such a study design and the results obtained suggest that, despite a small sample size, this approach can contribute to assess the impact of intervention methods, such as the efficacy vector-control measures or of malaria pre-erythrocytic stages vaccines.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases pose some of the greatest challenges in public health, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Efforts to control these diseases have been underpinned by a theoretical framework developed for malaria by Ross and Macdonald, including models, metrics for measuring transmission, and theory of control that identifies key vulnerabilities in the transmission cycle. That framework, especially Macdonald's formula for R0 and its entomological derivative, vectorial capacity, are now used to study dynamics and design interventions for many mosquito-borne diseases. A systematic review of 388 models published between 1970 and 2010 found that the vast majority adopted the Ross-Macdonald assumption of homogeneous transmission in a well-mixed population. Studies comparing models and data question these assumptions and point to the capacity to model heterogeneous, focal transmission as the most important but relatively unexplored component in current theory. Fine-scale heterogeneity causes transmission dynamics to be nonlinear, and poses problems for modeling, epidemiology and measurement. Novel mathematical approaches show how heterogeneity arises from the biology and the landscape on which the processes of mosquito biting and pathogen transmission unfold. Emerging theory focuses attention on the ecological and social context for mosquito blood feeding, the movement of both hosts and mosquitoes, and the relevant spatial scales for measuring transmission and for modeling dynamics and control.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites that concurrently infect a host compete on the basis of their intrinsic growth rates and by stimulating cross-reactive immune responses that inhibit each others' growth. If the phenotypes also show different drug sensitivities ('sensitive' vs. 'resistant' strains), drug treatment can change their joint dynamics and the long-term outcome of the infection: most obviously, persistent drug pressure can permit the more resistant, but otherwise competitively-inferior, strains to dominate. METHODS: Here a mathematical model is developed to analyse how these and more subtle effects of antimalarial drug use are modulated by immune response, repeated re-inoculation of parasites, drug pharmacokinetic parameters, dose and treatment frequency. RESULTS: The model quantifies possible effects of single and multiple (periodic) treatment on the outcome of parasite competition. In the absence of further inoculation, the dosage and/or treatment frequency required for complete clearance can be estimated. With persistent superinfection, time-average parasite densities can be derived in terms of the basic immune-regulating parameters, the drug efficacy and treatment regimen. CONCLUSION: The functional relations in the model are applicable to a wide range of conditions and transmission environments, allowing predictions to be made on both the individual and the community levels, and, in particular, transitions from drug-sensitive to drug-resistant parasite dominance to be projected on both levels.},

	abstract = {We have developed a pair of stochastic simulation models that describe the daily dynamics of dengue virus transmission in the urban environment. Our goal has been to construct comprehensive models that take into account the majority of factors known to influence dengue epidemiology. The models have an orientation toward site-specific data and are designed to be used by operational programs as well as researchers. The first model, the container-inhabiting mosquito simulation model (CIMSiM), a weather-driven dynamic Life-table model of container-inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti, provides inputs to the transmission model, the dengue simulation model (DENSiM); a description and validation of the entomology model was published previously. The basis of the transmission model is the simulation of a human population growing in response to country- and age-specific birth and death rates. An accounting of individual serologies is maintained by type of dengue virus, reflecting infection and birth to seropositive mothers. Daily estimates of adult mosquito survival, gonotrophic development, and the weight and number of emerging females from the CIMSiM are used to create the biting mosquito population in the DENSiM. The survival and emergence values determine the size of the population while the rate of gonotrophic development and female weight estimates influence biting frequency. Temperature and titer of virus in the human influences the extrinsic incubation period; titer may also influence the probability of transfer of virus from human to mosquito. The infection model within the DENSiM accounts for the development of virus within individuals and its passage between both populations. As in the case of the CIMSiM, the specific values used for any particular phenomenon are on menus where they can be readily changed. It is possible to simulate concurrent epidemics involving different serotypes. To provide a modicum of validation and to demonstrate the parameterization process for a specific location, we compare simulation results with reports on the nature of epidemics and seroprevalence of antibody in Honduras in low-lying coastal urbanizations and Tegucigalpa following the initial introduction of dengue-1 in 1978 into Central America. We conclude with some additional examples of simulation results to give an indication of the types of questions that can be investigated with the models.},

Predictions of the effects of control often ignore medium- and long-term dynamics. The complexities of the Plasmodium life-cycle, and of within-host dynamics, limit the applicability of conventional deterministic malaria models. We use individual-based stochastic simulations of malaria epidemiology to predict the impacts of interventions on infection, morbidity, mortality, health services use and costs. Individual infections are simulated by stochastic series of parasite densities, and naturally acquired immunity acts by reducing densities. Morbidity and mortality risks, and infectiousness to vectors, depend on parasite densities. The simulated infections are nested within simulations of individuals in human populations, and linked to models of interventions and health systems. We use numerous field datasets to optimise parameter estimates. By using a volunteer computing system we obtain the enormous computational power required for model fitting, sensitivity analysis, and exploration of many different intervention strategies. The project thus provides a general platform for comparing, fitting, and evaluating different model structures, and for quantitative prediction of effects of different interventions and integrated control programmes.},

The estimates range from around one to more than 3,000. We also consider malaria transmission and control in finite human populations, of size H. We show that classic formulas approximate the expected number of mosquitoes that could trace infection back to one mosquito after one parasite generation, Z0(H), but they overestimate the expected number of infected humans per infected human, R0(H). Heterogeneous biting increases R0 and, as we show, Z0(H), but we also show that it sometimes reduces R0(H); those who are bitten most both infect many vectors and absorb infectious bites. The large range of R0 estimates strongly supports the long-held notion that malaria control presents variable challenges across its transmission spectrum. In populations where R0 is highest, malaria control will require multiple, integrated methods that target those who are bitten most. Therefore, strategic planning for malaria control should consider R0, the spatial scale of transmission, human population density, and heterogeneous biting.},

	abstract = {The spectrum of disease severity in Plasmodium falciparum malaria can be attributed to heterogeneity in parasite virulence or to heterogeneity in host factors. However, the two are not neccessarily separate explanations for the same phenomena: they may actually complement each other. The conjoint effects of host and parasite heterogeneity can serve to explain certain intriguing epidemiological observations, such as, why there is a reduction in incidence of severe malaria in certain host genotypes without a concomitant reduction in mild disease. By assuming that severe disease is caused by a rare independently transmitted parasite strain, and that the probability of disease is nonlinearly related to the number of effective infections by a certain strain, the disproportionate reduction in the rate of the rarer disease within resistant host genotypes may be explained. Conversely, heterogeneity in host resistance may, under certain circumstances, facilitate the maintenance of diversity in parasite virulence. In this paper we discuss the coevolutionary consequences of heterogeneity in host resistance and diversity in parasite virulence by using a simple mathematical model that attempts to integrate the population genetics of the system with its ecological dynamics. This allows a unified perspective on malaria transmission that synthesises current evidence regarding the effects of host and parasite heterogeneities on malarial disease.},

The increasing complexity of these models limits their ability to abstract ecological processes and to address questions on the regulation of population dynamics using time-series data, particularly in regards to interactions between different pathogens and the regulatory role of innate (bottom-up) and acquired (top-down) immunity. We use a theoretical framework to test hypotheses on the importance of population-level immunity and parasite abundance in regulating the population dynamics of malaria. We use qualitative loop analyses to examine the sign of the interaction between Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax at the population level, and we discuss implications of this sign for the within-host regulation of parasites. Our analyses of monthly malaria time-series data from the island of Espirito Santo, Vanuatu (1983-1997), show that the dynamics of P. falciparum are not sensitive to P. vivax, whereas infections by the latter increase in response to those of the former. These results support a differential use of resources inside the hosts, a resource-consumer interaction between hosts and their immune system, and within-host regulation of parasites. Finally, our results emphasize the need to better understand factors regulating malaria dynamics before developing control strategies and call for the use of control strategies directed at the interruption of transmission, such as vector control and the use of bed nets.},

Three scenarios of larval interventions were evaluated in relation to impacts on parasitological indicators of malaria transmission. Our results show that it is unnecessary to manage all aquatic habitats to obtain significant reductions in incidence and prevalence of malaria in situations of low and intermediate levels of transmission.

We show in this field study conducted in 30 sites along the coastal Kenya that prevalence in school children was consistently high, although there were many sites where transmission intensity measured by exposure to infectious bites was less than 10 per year. Statistical analyses revealed that prevalence was significantly correlated with the infectious exposure occurring 10-11 months previously, suggesting that long-lived infections were commonplace and one of the major contributors for the stability of malaria in these sites. Using mechanistic models of malaria transmission, we found that the association of high prevalence and low transmission could be due to low recovery rates. Therefore, significant reductions of malaria prevalence and burden require substantial reductions of the duration of acquired infections, even in areas that have quite low transmission intensities by the standards of sub-Saharan Africa. Infection control featured by active detection and drug treatment as well as vector control is critical to combat malaria in areas of relatively low transmission intensity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early warning systems (EWS) are management tools to predict the occurrence of epidemics of infectious diseases. While climate-based EWS have been developed for malaria, no standard protocol to evaluate and compare EWS has been proposed. Additionally, there are several neglected tropical diseases whose transmission is sensitive to environmental conditions, for which no EWS have been proposed, though they represent a large burden for the affected populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present paper, an overview of the available linear and non-linear tools to predict seasonal time series of diseases is presented. Also, a general methodology to compare and evaluate models for prediction is presented and illustrated using American cutaneous leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease, as an example. The comparison of the different models using the predictive R(2) for forecasts of “out-of-fit” data (data that has not been used to fit the models) shows that for the several linear and non-linear models tested, the best results were obtained for seasonal autoregressive (SAR) models that incorporate climatic covariates. An additional bootstrapping experiment shows that the relationship of the disease time series with the climatic covariates is strong and consistent for the SAR modeling approach. While the autoregressive part of the model is not significant, the exogenous forcing due to climate is always statistically significant. Prediction accuracy can vary from 50\% to over 80\% for disease burden at time scales of one year or shorter. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: this study illustrates a protocol for the development of EWS that includes three main steps: (i) the fitting of different models using several methodologies, (ii) the comparison of models based on the predictability of “out-of-fit” data, and (iii) the assessment of the robustness of the relationship between the disease and the variables in the model selected as best with an objective criterion.},

It depends on the duration of the infectious period, the probability of infecting a susceptible individual during one contact, and the number of new susceptible individuals contacted per unit of time. Therefore R0 may vary considerably for different infectious diseases but also for the same disease in different populations. The key threshold result of epidemic theory associates the outbreaks of epidemics and the persistence of endemic levels with basic reproduction numbers greater than one. Because the magnitude of R0 allows one to determine the amount of effort which is necessary either to prevent an epidemic or to eliminate an infection from a population, it is crucial to estimate R0 for a given disease in a particular population.

In this model, new infections and recoveries are assessed by the daily inoculation rate and are subject to laws of chance. Such a representation is closer than previous models to natural happenings in the process of malaria eradication. Further refinements of the new approach include the seasonal transmission and simulation of mass chemotherapy aimed at a cure of P. falciparum infections.These programmes present models on which the actual or expected results of changes due to various factors can be studied by the analysis of specific malaria situations recorded in the field. The value of control methods can also be tested by the study of such hypothetical epidemiological models and by trying out various procedures.Two specific malaria situations (in a pilot project in Northern Nigeria and in an outbreak in Syria) were studied by this method and provided some interesting results of operational value. The attack measures in the pilot project in Northern Nigeria were carried out according to the theoretical model derived from the basic data obtained in the field.},

Socioeconomic factors measured directly at the individual level and site-specific malaria prevalence predicted for the Demographic and Health Surveys' locations by a spatial model fitted to the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa database were examined as possible risk factors. The analysis was carried out by fitting a Bayesian hierarchical geostatistical logistic model to infant mortality risk, by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. It confirmed that mother's education, birth order and interval, infant's sex, residence, and mother's age at infant's birth had a strong impact on infant mortality risk in Mali. The residual spatial pattern of infant mortality showed a clear relation to well-known foci of malaria transmission, especially the inland delta of the Niger River. No effect of estimated parasite prevalence could be demonstrated. Possible explanations include confounding by unmeasured covariates and sparsity of the source malaria data. Spatial statistical models of malaria prevalence are useful for indicating approximate levels of endemicity over wide areas and, hence, for guiding intervention strategies.

Recent studies have highlighted the impact of reduced availability of aquatic habitats on mosquito foraging for hosts and oviposition sites.

Mosquito foraging was represented as a two-stage process: random flight when the resource was not within the mosquito's perception range and directional flight to the resource when it was detected. Three scenarios of targeted source reduction were devised to eliminate all aquatic habitats within certain distances of human habitations. For comparison, three non-targeted source reductions randomly eliminated the same numbers of aquatic habitats as their corresponding targeted scenarios. Our results show that the elimination of habitats within 100m, 200m and 300m of surrounding houses resulted in 13\%, 91\% and 94\% reductions in malaria incidence, respectively; compared with -3\%, 19\% and 44\%, respectively, for the corresponding conventional interventions. These findings indicate that source reduction might not require coverage of extensive areas, as previously thought, and that the distance to human habitations can be used for habitat targeting.},

The role of climate variability in driving epidemic cycles at interannual time scales remains controversial, in part because it has been seen as conflicting with the alternative explanation of purely endogenous cycles exclusively generated by the nonlinear dynamics of the disease. We analyse a long temporal record of monthly cases from 1970 to 2003 in a highland of western Kenya with both a time-series epidemiological model ( time-series susceptible infected - recovered) and a statistical approach specifically developed for non-stationary patterns. Results show that multiyear cycles of malaria outbreaks appear in the 1980s, concomitant with the timing of a regime shift in the dynamics of cases; the cycles become more pronounced in the 1990s, when the coupling between disease and rainfall is also stronger as the variance of rainfall increased at the frequencies of coupling. Disease dynamics and climate forcing play complementary and interacting roles at different temporal scales. Thus, these mechanisms should not be viewed as alternative and their interaction needs to be integrated in the development of future predictive models.},

The benefits derived from this intervention are indirectly quantified in this article by estimating the number of cases that would have ocurred in the area if remedial measures had not been applied.For this purpose a simple mathematical model was fitted to both the number of cases in January (seasonal minimum) and the number of cases in July/August (seasonal maximum) that were recorded during the years 1976, 1977, and the beginning of 1978; the incidence trend from 1978 onwards was then determined by projection. By this method, it was possible to estimate that in the absence of intervention the projected annual parasite incidence would have been 75.4 per 1000 in 1978 instead of the observed incidence of 24.5 per 1000. According to the forecast, this incidence would have reached 100.9 per 1000 in 1979, 115.1 per 1000 in 1980, to arrive at a final stable level of 129.4 per 1000, if intervention measures had not been applied.Comparison of the number of malaria cases actually detected in 1978 (70 468) with the number projected in the absence of intervention (226 252) seems to indicate that about 2/3 of the expected cases were prevented in 1978 by the remedial measures applied.},

	abstract = {The question is approached through three examples. Ross's model, although very simple and formulated a priori, yielded important epidemiological insights: the existence of a threshold contact rate (vectorial capacity); the decreasing sensitivity of the endemic level to changes in the contact rate, as the latter gets larger; the return to the same equilibrium endemic level, as long as the contact rate remains the same; the progressively decreasing impact of a given reduction in the contact rate until a new equilibrium is reached. The second example is Macdonald's model, in particular his sensitivity analysis; two constraints are pointed out: the weakest point, on which to concentrate control efforts, cannot be identified automatically by the sensitivity analysis; the calculation of the expected impact of an intervention commonly assumes too much uniformity (e.g. of human of vector behaviour) and this commonly leads to exaggerated expectations. The third example is the Garki model, briefly considered in terms of its assumptions, of its behaviour, of its actual utilization (only for teaching, so far), and of the cost of its development. Looking forward, three uses of models are discussed. It is suggested that, critically used, they have a place in training, in planning control and in research. With respect to their application to planning, it is argued that the need for new data is not necessarily great, also that some rather difficult direct measurements might be substituted by indirect measurements, a point illustrated by the expected relationships, following the Garki model, between different dimensions of “intensity” of malaria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Many of the first European settlers in Africa sought refuge from the heat and diseases of the plains by moving to the cool and salubrious highlands. Although many of the highlands were originally malaria free, there has been a progressive rise in the incidence of the disease over the last 50 years, largely as a consequence of agroforestry development, and it has been exacerbated by scarce health resources. In these areas of fringe transmission where the malaria pattern is unstable, epidemics may be precipitated by relatively subtle climatic changes. Since there is little immunity against the disease in these communities, outbreaks can be devastating, resulting in a substantial increase in morbidity and death among both children and adults. We present here the results obtained using a mathematical model designed to identify these epidemic-prone regions in the African highlands and the differences expected to occur as a result of projected global climate change. These highlands should be recognized as an area of special concern. We further recommend that a regional modelling approach should be adopted to assess the extent and severity of this problem and help improve disease surveillance and the quality of health care delivered in this unstable ecosystem. This article explores the past, present and future trends of malaria in the African highlands. Over the last 50 years, there has been a progressive increase in the incidence of malaria in the region, particularly in the highlands. This trend is brought primarily as a consequence of agroforestry development and the scarcity of health resources. In these areas of fringe transmission where malaria pattern is unstable, outbreaks may be precipitated by certain climate and biological factors that favors the growth and development of mosquito vector and parasite. Since there is little immunity against the disease in these communities, epidemics can be devastating, resulting in a significant rise in morbidity and mortality among children and adults. This paper outlines the results using a mathematical model designed to determine epidemic-prone regions in the African highlands and the differences that are expected to occur as a product of projected global climate change. These communities should be recognized as an area of special attention. A regional modeling approach is recommended to examine the extent of severity of the problem and to improve disease surveillance and the quality of health care services.},

	abstract = {Molecular genetic analyses of P. falciparum have led to the cloning and sequencing of a number of antigens that are potential candidates for vaccination against malaria. Seroepidemiological studies in endemic areas have attempted to assess the relative importance of these antigens in protection against malaria. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the relative contributions of conserved and strain-specific immune responses by modelling their influence of age-specific patterns of infection and disease. The modelling exercises in this paper clearly demonstrate that the observed patterns ns of age-prevalence are best explained by proposing that the accumulation to a threshold of an immune response against a conserved determinant is required for protection against infection, while 'antidisease' immunity develops more linearly with exposure. This is compatible with the conjecture that the parasite population is structured into several independently, transmitted strains, that each confers some degree of 'antidisease' immunity, but does not protect against further infection by the same strain. Within this framework, the average duration of parasitaemia increases with age, as previously encountered strains endure for longer periods at a subclinical level. Indirect evidence for the increase in duration of parasitaemia with age may be obtained from a comparison of age-prevalence curves between dry and rainy seasons. By using mathematical methods to structure epidemiological and immunological information, we provide a coherent theoretical framework for the dissection of the important components of naturally acquired immunity to malaria.},

When mosquitoes concentrate on certain hosts, the basic reproductive rate, R, of the disease (a measure of persistence) and the vectorial capacity are both greater than or equal to their values under homogeneous mixing. Field data suggest that R could be more than two and a half times as large as it would be under homogeneous mixing. Our calculations underestimate the importance of heterogeneity by ignoring mosquito patchiness and stochastic effects. Host selection limits the dependability of predictions, made from population models which assume homogeneous mixing, about the success of disease control (vaccines, chemotherapy, vector control). In particular, eradication or the maintenance of low prevalence will be more difficult than expected, unless localized control makes the distribution of infective bites on a community more nearly uniform. Age may explain most of the variability in biting in small communities (e.g., rural villages), in which case models incorporating age-specific biting will be appropriate tools in control programmes.},

	abstract = {Present methods for assessment of the attack phase of malaria eradication are inadequate, particularly lacking any objective parasitological criteria of success. On the basis of previous observations and development of theory, the authors first postulate that the effects of complete interruption of transmission should, ideally, include a regular progressive decrease of falciparum parasite rates in the ratios of 1: 0.4 in 6 months, 1: 0.16 in 12 months and 1: 0.026 in 24 months. Analysis of a series of programmes in which complete interruption of transmission is known to have been achieved shows that this postulate is valid, and that it is not materially upset by strain differences of parasites or by differences in the ages of the subjects examined. Vivax rates appear to fall at approximately the same rate; the rarity of data for vivax malaria makes firm conclusions unsure, but the postulate can be extended to rates which are predominantly due to falciparum infection but include some admixture of other species. A second, arbitrary, postulate is made that the slowest acceptable rate of fall in 12 months should be in a ratio not less than 1: 0.22, which would secure ultimate eradication in about one-third more time than the ideal fall; on this basis statistical standards are set up for assurance of confidence that the minimum rate is exceeded. Slower rates of fall are then related to reproduction rates causing them, the findings being illustrated graphically and by mathematical theory.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes commute between blood-meal hosts and water. Thus, heterogeneity in human biting reflects underlying spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and suitability of larval habitat as well as inherent differences in the attractiveness, suitability and distribution of blood-meal hosts. One of the possible strategies of malaria control is to identify local vector species and then attack water bodies that contain their larvae. METHODS: Biting and host seeking, not oviposition, have been the focus of most previous studies of mosquitoes and malaria transmission. This study presents a mathematical model that incorporates mosquito oviposition behaviour. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that oviposition is one potential factor explaining heterogeneous biting and vector distribution in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of larval habitat. Adult female mosquitoes tend to aggregate around places where they oviposit, thereby increasing the risk of malaria, regardless of the suitability of the habitat for larval development. Thus, a water body may be unsuitable for adult mosquito emergence, but simultaneously, be a source for human malaria. CONCLUSION: Larval density may be a misleading indicator of a habitat's importance for malaria control. Even if mosquitoes could be lured to oviposit in sprayed larval habitats, this would not necessarily mitigate – and might aggravate – the risk of malaria transmission. Forcing mosquitoes to fly away from humans in search of larval habitat may be a more efficient way to reduce the risk of malaria than killing larvae. Thus, draining, fouling, or filling standing water where mosquitoes oviposit can be more effective than applying larvicide.},

With an increasing number of countries embarking on malaria elimination programmes, national and local decisions to select combinations of tools and deployment strategies directed at malaria elimination must address rapidly changing transmission patterns across diverse geographic areas. However, not all of these approaches can be systematically evaluated in the field. Thus, there is potential for modelling to investigate appropriate 'packages' of combined interventions that include various forms of vector control, case management, surveillance, and population-based approaches for different settings, particularly at lower transmission levels. Modelling can help prioritise which intervention packages should be tested in field studies, suggest which intervention package should be used at a particular level or stratum of transmission intensity, estimate the risk of resurgence when scaling down specific interventions after local transmission is interrupted, and evaluate the risk and impact of parasite drug resistance and vector insecticide resistance. However, modelling intervention package deployment against a heterogeneous transmission background is a challenge. Further validation of malaria models should be pursued through an iterative process, whereby field data collected with the deployment of intervention packages is used to refine models and make them progressively more relevant for assessing and predicting elimination outcomes.},

In this article, starting from the basic Ross model, the key mathematical models and their underlying features, based on their specific contributions in the understanding of spread and transmission of malaria have been discussed. The first aim of this article is to develop, starting from the basic models, a hierarchical structure of a range of deterministic models of different levels of complexity. The second objective is to elaborate, using some of the representative mathematical models, the evolution of modelling strategies to describe malaria incidence by including the critical features of host-vector-parasite interactions. Emphasis is more on the evolution of the deterministic differential equation based epidemiological compartment models with a brief discussion on data based statistical models. In this comprehensive survey, the approach has been to summarize the modelling activity in this area so that it helps reach a wider range of researchers working on epidemiology, transmission, and other aspects of malaria. This may facilitate the mathematicians to further develop suitable models in this direction relevant to the present scenario, and help the biologists and public health personnel to adopt better understanding of the modelling strategies to control the disease.},

In endemic areas, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum can cause both acute, severe infections and asymptomatic, chronic infections through its interaction with the host immune system. Frequent superinfection and massive parasite genetic diversity make it extremely difficult to accurately measure the distribution of infection lengths, complicating the estimation of basic epidemiological parameters and the prediction of the impact of interventions. Mathematical models have qualitatively reproduced parasite dynamics early during infection, but reproducing long-lived chronic infections remains much more challenging. Here, we construct a model of infection dynamics to examine the consequences of common biological assumptions for the generation of chronicity and the impact of co-infection. We find that although a combination of host and parasite heterogeneities are capable of generating chronic infections, they do so only under restricted parameter choices. Furthermore, under biologically plausible assumptions, co-infection of parasite genotypes can alter the course of infection of both the resident and co-infecting strain in complex non-intuitive ways. We outline the most important puzzles for within-host models of malaria arising from our analysis, and their implications for malaria epidemiology and control.},

It is fitted to multiple datasets from field studies of the relationship between malaria infection and the EIR. We propose that this model can account for non-monotonic relationships between the age of the host and the parasite prevalence and incidence of disease. It provides a parsimonious explanation for the faster acquisition of natural immunity in adults than in children exposed to high EIRs.

	abstract = {Malaria is caused by infection with protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium transmitted by female Anopheles species mosquitoes. Our understanding of the malaria parasites begins in 1880 with the discovery of the parasites in the blood of malaria patients by Alphonse Laveran. The sexual stages in the blood were discovered by William MacCallum in birds infected with a related haematozoan, Haemoproteus columbae, in 1897 and the whole of the transmission cycle in culicine mosquitoes and birds infected with Plasmodium relictum was elucidated by Ronald Ross in 1897. In 1898 the Italian malariologists, Giovanni Battista Grassi, Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli, Angelo Celli, Camillo Golgi and Ettore Marchiafava demonstrated conclusively that human malaria was also transmitted by mosquitoes, in this case anophelines. The discovery that malaria parasites developed in the liver before entering the blood stream was made by Henry Shortt and Cyril Garnham in 1948 and the final stage in the life cycle, the presence of dormant stages in the liver, was conclusively demonstrated in 1982 by Wojciech Krotoski. This article traces the main events and stresses the importance of comparative studies in that, apart from the initial discovery of parasites in the blood, every subsequent discovery has been based on studies on non-human malaria parasites and related organisms.},

Few attempts have been made to fit such models to field data. We propose a stochastic simulation model to predict the distributions of P. falciparum parasite densities in endemic areas, in which acquired immunity acts by reducing parasite densities. We have fitted this model to age-specific prevalence and geometric mean densities from settings in Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania. The model appears to reproduce reasonably well the parasitologic patterns seen in malariologic surveys in endemic areas and is appropriate for predicting the impact of interventions such as vaccination in the context of continual exposure to P. falciparum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the encouraging advent of new malaria vaccine candidates, mathematical modelling of expected impacts of present and future vaccines as part of multi-intervention strategies is especially relevant. METHODS: The impact of potential malaria vaccines is presented utilizing the EMOD model, a comprehensive model of the vector life cycle coupled to a detailed mechanistic representation of intra-host parasite and immune dynamics. Values of baseline transmission and vector feeding behaviour parameters are identified, for which local elimination is enabled by layering pre-erythrocytic vaccines of various efficacies on top of high and sustained insecticide-treated net coverage. The expected reduction in clinical cases is further explored in a scenario that targets children by adding a pre-erythrocytic vaccine to the EPI programme for newborns. RESULTS: At high transmission, there is a minimal reduction in clinical disease cases, as the time to infection is only slightly delayed. At lower transmission, there is an accelerating community-level protection that has subtle dependences on heterogeneities in vector behaviour, ecology, and intervention coverage. At very low transmission, the trend reverses as many children are vaccinated to prevent few cases. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum-impact setting is one in which the impact of increasing bed net coverage has saturated, vector feeding is primarily outdoors, and transmission is just above the threshold where small perturbations from a vaccine intervention result in large community benefits.},

	abstract = {It has been recognized since ancient times that malaria fever is highly periodic but the mechanism has been poorly understood. Malaria fever is related to the parasite growth cycle in erythrocytes. After a fixed period of replication, a mature parasite (schizont) causes the infected erythrocyte to rupture, releasing progeny that quickly invade other erythrocytes. Simultaneous rupture of a large number of schizonts stimulates a host fever response. Febrile temperatures are damaging to Plasmodium falciparum, particularly in the second half of its 48-hr replicative cycle. Using a mathematical model, we show that these interactions naturally tend to generate periodic fever. The model predicts chaotic parasite population dynamics at high multiplication rates, consistent with the classical observation that P. falciparum causes less regular fever than other species of parasite.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The development of parasitological immunity against malaria affects the ability to detect infection, the efficiency of the local human parasite reservoir at infecting mosquitoes, and the response to reintroduction of parasites to previously cleared areas. Observations of similar age-trends in detected prevalence and mean parasitaemia across more than an order-of-magnitude of variation in baseline transmission complicate simple exposure-driven explanations. METHODS:Mathematical models often employ age-dependent immune factors to match the observed trends, while the present model uses a new detailed mechanistic model of parasite transmission dynamics to explain age-trends through the mechanism of parasite diversity. Illustrative simulations are performed for multiple field sites in Tanzania and Nigeria, and observed age-trends and seasonality in parasite prevalence are recreated in silico, proffering possible mechanistic explanations of the observational data. RESULTS:Observed temporal dynamics in measured parasitaemia are recreated for each location and age-prevalence outputs are studied. Increasing population-level diversity in malaria surface antigens delays development of broad parasitological immunity. A local parasite population with high diversity can recreate the observed trends in age-prevalence across more than an order of magnitude of variation in transmission intensities. CONCLUSIONS:Mechanistic models of human immunity and parasite antigen diversity can recreate the observed temporal patterns for the development of parasitological immunity across a wide range of transmission intensities. This has implications for the distribution of disease burden across the population, the human transmission reservoir, design of elimination campaigns, and development and roll-out of potential vaccines.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, the impact of climate change on human health has attracted considerable attention; the effects on malaria have been of particular interest because of its disease burden and its transmission sensitivity to environmental conditions.Objectives: We investigated and illustrated the role that dynamic process-based mathematical models can play in providing strategic insights into the effects of climate change on malaria transmission.Methods: We evaluated a relatively simple model that permitted valuable and novel insights into the simultaneous effects of rainfall and temperature on mosquito population dynamics, malaria invasion, persistence and local seasonal extinction, and the impact of seasonality on transmission. We illustrated how large-scale climate simulations and infectious disease systems may be modeled and analyzed and how these methods may be applied to predicting changes in the basic reproduction number of malaria across Tanzania.Results: We found extinction to be more strongly dependent on rainfall than on temperature and identified a temperature window of around 32-33 degrees C where endemic transmission and the rate of spread in disease-free regions is optimized. This window was the same for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, but mosquito density played a stronger role in driving the rate of malaria spread than did the Plasmodium species. The results improved our understanding of how temperature shifts affect the global distribution of at-risk regions, as well as how rapidly malaria outbreaks take off within vulnerable populations.Conclusions: Disease emergence, extinction, and transmission all depend strongly on climate. Mathematical models offer powerful tools for understanding geographic shifts in incidence as climate changes. Nonlinear dependences of transmission on climate necessitates consideration of both changing climate trends and variability across time scales of interest. Editor's SummaryThere has been increased interest in the possible impact of climate change on human health, particularly as it relates to the transmission of environmentally sensitive diseases such as malaria. Parham and Michael (p. 620) investigated the role that process-based mathematical models can play in providing strategic insights on the effects of climate change on malaria transmission. They evaluated a relatively simple to model to assess the simultaneous effects of rainfall and temperature on mosquito population dynamics, malaria invasion, persistence and extinction, and the impact of seasonality on transmission. The authors report that rainfall patterns were strongly associated with malaria endemicity, invasion, and extinction. Temperature had a more complex relationship with transmission and a stronger influence on the rate of disease spread and survival. Seasonality of rainfall may have marked effects on reproduction and extinction dynamics, even at optimal transmission temperatures. The results of this study could improve understanding of the effects of temperature shifts on the global distribution of malaria in at-risk regions and the rate of malaria transmission within vulnerable populations.},

	abstract = {Many questions remain about P. falciparum within-host dynamics, immunity, and transmission-issues that may affect public health campaign planning. These gaps in knowledge concern the distribution of durations of malaria infections, determination of peak parasitemia during acute infection, the relationships among gametocytes and immune responses and infectiousness to mosquitoes, and the effect of antigenic structure on reinfection outcomes. The present model of intra-host dynamics of P. falciparum implements detailed representations of parasite and immune dynamics, with structures based on minimal extrapolations from first-principles biology in its foundations. The model is designed to quickly and readily accommodate gains in mechanistic understanding and to evaluate effects of alternative biological hypothesis through in silico experiments. Simulations follow the parasite from the liver-stage through the detailed asexual cycle to clearance while tracking gametocyte populations. The modeled immune system includes innate inflammatory and specific antibody responses to a repertoire of antigens. The mechanistic focus provides clear explanations for the structure of the distribution of infection durations through the interaction of antigenic variation and innate and adaptive immunity. Infectiousness to mosquitoes appears to be determined not only by the density of gametocytes but also by the level of inflammatory cytokines, which harmonizes an extensive series of study results. Finally, pre-existing immunity can either decrease or increase the duration of infections upon reinfection, depending on the degree of overlap in antigenic repertoires and the strength of the pre-existing immunity.},

	abstract = {The success of malaria eradication campaigns depends on the use of all methods that make for a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of mosquito vectors. One such method is precipitin testing, by which it is possible to identify the human or animal origin of blood-meals of mosquitos and thereby to determine their host preferences and vectorial importance, both generally and locally.In 1955 the World Health Organization, in agreement with the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, Elstree, England, set up a precipitin test service available to national research institutions and field staff of malaria eradication projects. The results of the tests carried out in 1959-64 are now presented in summary form; the data were obtained from nearly 41 000 blood smears collected from 79 species of Anopheles. In addition, the previously published results of the 1955-59 period are retabulated and data are presented on nearly 27 000 tests carried out independently at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Delhi, India, on Anopheles from Ceylon, India and Nepal. Altogether the review covers some 124 000 precipitin tests on 92 Anopheles species; about 93\% of the tests gave a positive result with one or other of the antisera used, but attention is chiefly paid to the proportion of blood-meals taken on man.There are practical difficulties in achieving representative sampling of Anopheles populations for determination of the human blood index, but some can be overcome by increased care in sampling from a representative selection of biotopes. In areas that have been sprayed with insecticide, an attempt should be made to include mosquitos knocked down by the insecticide after feeding.},

These prevalence hindcasts are second-tier validated against estimates from the MTSM driven with ERA-40 gridded analyses. The DEMETER-MTSM prevalence hindcasts are shown to be (tier-2) skilful for the one-month lead seasonal predictions as well as for the period covering the seasonal malaria peak with a 4-6 month forecast window for the event prevalence above the median. Interestingly, the tier-2 Brier skill score for the forecast window of the hindcasts starting in February, for the event prevalence above the median, is higher than for either the tier-1 precipitation or temperature forecasts, which were the MTSM driving variables.},

Mathematical models for planning malaria eradication benefit from detailed representations of local mosquito populations, their natural dynamics and their response to campaign pressures. METHODS: A new model is presented for mosquito population dynamics, effects of weather, and impacts of multiple simultaneous interventions. This model is then embedded in a large-scale individual-based simulation and results for local elimination of malaria are discussed. Mosquito population behaviours, such as anthropophily and indoor feeding, are included to study their effect upon the efficacy of vector control-based elimination campaigns. RESULTS: Results for vector control tools, such as bed nets, indoor spraying, larval control and space spraying, both alone and in combination, are displayed for a single-location simulation with vector species and seasonality characteristic of central Tanzania, varying baseline transmission intensity and vector bionomics. The sensitivities to habitat type, anthropophily, indoor feeding, and baseline transmission intensity are explored. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to model a spectrum of local vector species with different ecologies and behaviours allows local customization of packages of interventions and exploration of the effect of proposed new tools.},

The study is based on daily data, collected from 262 individual courses of parasitaemia. We propose several mathematical models that follow biological reasoning.

The models differ in the assumptions made about the mortality of circulating gametocytes and about the transition rate of the asexual parasites. Gametocyte mortality is modelled as being (i) constant over time, (ii) linearly increasing over time, (iii) linearly increasing over gametocyte age, and (iv) exponentially increasing over gametocyte age, respectively. The transition rate is either kept constant per patient or piecewise constant within intervals that correspond to waves of asexual parasitaemia which are assumed to be caused by different Pf(emp1)-variants. According to likelihood ratio tests, the models with age-dependent mortality rate and wave-dependent transition rates are superior to the models with constant transition rate and/or constant or time-dependent mortality rate. The best fits are reached for models with exponentially increasing (Gompertz-type) mortality. Furthermore, an impact of high asexual parasite densities on the survival of gametocytes, interpreted as a cytokine-mediated effect, is evident in some cases.},

It also allows for the need for the blood meal to contain gametocytes of both sexes if infection is to take place. We show that by fitting this model to data from malariatherapy patients it can explain observed patterns of infectiousness of the human host and is consistent with distributions of gametocyte densities in malariatherapy patients. By integrating this model into an individual-based simulation of human populations exposed to endemic P. falciparum transmission, we are able to predict the contributions of different host age groups to the infectious reservoir. Comparison of model predictions with published estimates of this quantity confirms that infected adults hosts are likely to make a significant contribution to the reservoir of transmission, and points to the need for improved population-based estimates of this age-dependence in infectivity of humans in endemic areas.},

	abstract = {Human infection by malarial parasites of the genus Plasmodium begins with the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Current estimates place malaria mortality at over 650,000 individuals each year, mostly in African children. Efforts to reduce disease burden can benefit from the development of mathematical models of disease transmission. To date, however, comprehensive modeling of the parameters defining human infectivity to mosquitoes has remained elusive. Here, we describe a mechanistic within-host model of Plasmodium falciparum infection in humans and pathogen transmission to the mosquito vector. Our model incorporates the entire parasite lifecycle, including the intra-erythrocytic asexual forms responsible for disease, the onset of symptoms, the development and maturation of intra-erythrocytic gametocytes that are transmissible to Anopheles mosquitoes, and human-to-mosquito infectivity. These model components were parameterized from malaria therapy data and other studies to simulate individual infections, and the ensemble of outputs was found to reproduce the full range of patient responses to infection. Using this model, we assessed human infectivity over the course of untreated infections and examined the effects in relation to transmission intensity, expressed by the basic reproduction number R0 (defined as the number of secondary cases produced by a single typical infection in a completely susceptible population). Our studies predict that net human-to-mosquito infectivity from a single non-immune individual is on average equal to 32 fully infectious days. This estimate of mean infectivity is equivalent to calculating the human component of malarial R0 . We also predict that mean daily infectivity exceeds five percent for approximately 138 days. The mechanistic framework described herein, made available as stand-alone software, will enable investigators to conduct detailed studies into theories of malaria control, including the effects of drug treatment and drug resistance on transmission.},

	abstract = {Individuals living in regions where malaria is endemic develop an acquired immunity to malaria which enables them to remain asymptomatic while still carrying parasites. Field studies indicate that cumulative exposure to a variety of diverse Plasmodium parasites is required for the transition from symptomatic to asymptomatic malaria. This study used a simulation model of the within-host dynamics of P. falciparum to investigate the development of acquired clinical immunity under different transmission conditions and levels of parasite diversity. Antibodies developed to P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a clonally variant molecule, were assumed to be a key human immunological response to P. falciparum infection, along with responses to clonally conserved but polymorphic antigens. The time to the development of clinical immunity was found to be proportional to parasite diversity and inversely proportional to transmission intensity. The effect of early termination of symptomatic infections by chemotherapy was investigated and found not to inhibit the host's ability to develop acquired immunity. However, the time required to achieve this state was approximately double that compared to when no treatment was administered. This study demonstrates that an immune response primarily targeted against PfEMP1 has the ability to reduce clinical symptoms of infections irrespective of whether treatment is administered, supporting its role in the development of acquired clinical immunity. The results also illustrate a novel use for simulation models of P. falciparum infections, investigation of the influence of intervention strategies on the development of naturally acquired clinical immunity.},

A sensitivity analysis done in 3 distinct geographic areas shows that die areas of largest change of epidemic potential caused by a temperature increase are those where mosquitoes already occur but where development of the parasite is limited by temperature.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals continuously exposed to malaria gradually acquire immunity that protects from severe disease and high levels of parasitization. Acquired immunity has been incorporated into numerous models of malaria transmission of varying levels of complexity (e.g. Bull World Health Organ 50:347, 1974; Am J Trop Med Hyg 75:19, 2006; Math Biosci 90:385-396, 1988). Most such models require prescribing inputs of mosquito biting rates or other entomological or epidemiological information. Here, we present a model with a novel structure that uses environmental controls of mosquito population dynamics to simulate the mosquito biting rates, malaria prevalence as well as variability in protective immunity of the population. METHODS: A simple model of acquired immunity to malaria is presented and tested within the framework of the Hydrology, Entomology and Malaria Transmission Simulator (HYDREMATS), a coupled hydrology and agent-based entomology model. The combined model uses environmental data including rainfall, temperature, and topography to simulate malaria prevalence and level of acquired immunity in the human population. The model is used to demonstrate the effect of acquired immunity on malaria prevalence in two Niger villages that are hydrologically and entomologically very different. Simulations are conducted for the year 2006 and compared to malaria prevalence observations collected from the two villages. RESULTS: Blood smear samples from children show no clear difference in malaria prevalence between the two villages despite pronounced differences in observed mosquito abundance. The similarity in prevalence is attributed to the moderating effect of acquired immunity, which depends on prior exposure to the parasite through infectious bites - and thus the hydrologically determined mosquito abundance. Modelling the level of acquired immunity can affect village vulnerability to climatic anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: The model presented has a novel structure constituting a mechanistic link between spatial and temporal environmental variability and village-scale malaria transmission. Incorporating acquired immunity into the model has allowed simulation of prevalence in the two villages, and isolation of the effects of acquired immunity in dampening the difference in prevalence between the two villages. Without these effects, the difference in prevalence between the two villages would have been significantly larger in response to the large differences in mosquito populations and the associated biting rates.},

A fraction of the asexual parasites develops into gametocytes (gamete precursors) while sequestered in deep tissues. After re-entering the circulation, gametocytes can be picked up by a mosquito to continue the parasite's life-cycle. We present estimates of the conversion probability from asexual parasites to circulating gametocytes and of the gametocytes' sequestration and circulation times, obtained for the first time by fitting a dynamic model to individual patients' histories (daily records of 113 neurosyphilitic patients undergoing malariatherapy). The model assumes that the conversion probability can vary among the successive waves of asexual parasitaemia of a patient, and that gametocytes die at an age-dependent rate which increases under high asexual parasite densities. On average, 1 gametocyte per 156 asexual parasites (range 7.4-3700) is produced. The most remarkable findings are the large individual variation of conversion probabilities and circulation times, the average gametocyte circulation time of 6.4 days (range 1.3-22.2 days) which is more than twice the currently accepted value, and the large variation of conversion probabilities among successive waves of asexual parasitaemia without any particular time pattern. The latter finding could be explained by an association between conversion probability and variation of PfEMP1.},

	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10761719},
	abstract = {The expense and ineffectiveness of drift-based insecticide aerosols to control dengue epidemics has led to suppression strategies based on eliminating larval breeding sites. With the notable but short-lived exceptions of Cuba and Singapore, these source reduction efforts have met with little documented success; failure has chiefly been attributed to inadequate participation of the communities involved. The present work attempts to estimate transmission thresholds for dengue based on an easily-derived statistic, the standing crop of Aedes aegypti pupae per person in the environment. We have developed these thresholds for use in the assessment of risk of transmission and to provide targets for the actual degree of suppression required to prevent or eliminate transmission in source reduction programs. The notion of thresholds is based on 2 concepts: the mass action principal-the course of an epidemic is dependent on the rate of contact between susceptible hosts and infectious vectors, and threshold theory-the introduction of a few infectious individuals into a community of susceptible individuals will not give rise to an outbreak unless the density of vectors exceeds a certain critical level. We use validated transmission models to estimate thresholds as a function of levels of pre-existing antibody levels in human populations, ambient air temperatures, and size and frequency of viral introduction. Threshold levels were estimated to range between about 0.5 and 1.5 Ae. aegypti pupae per person for ambient air temperatures of 28 degrees C and initial seroprevalences ranging between 0\% to 67\%. Surprisingly, the size of the viral introduction used in these studies, ranging between 1 and 12 infectious individuals per year, was not seen to significantly influence the magnitude of the threshold. From a control perspective, these results are not particularly encouraging. The ratio of Ae. aegypti pupae to human density has been observed in limited field studies to range between 0.3 and {\textgreater}60 in 25 sites in dengue-endemic or dengue-susceptible areas in the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia. If, for purposes of illustration, we assume an initial seroprevalence of 33\%, the degree of suppression required to essentially eliminate the possibility of summertime transmission in Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Bangkok, Thailand was estimated to range between 10\% and 83\%; however in Mexico and Trinidad, reductions of {\textgreater}90\% would be required. A clearer picture of the actual magnitude of the reductions required to eliminate the threat of transmission is provided by the ratio of the observed standing crop of Ae. aegypti pupae per person and the threshold. For example, in a site in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, the ratio of observed and threshold was 1.7, meaning roughly that about 7 of every 17 breeding containers would have to be eliminated. For Reynosa, Mexico, with a ratio of approximately 10, 9 of every 10 containers would have to be eliminated. For sites in Trinidad with ratios averaging approximately 25, the elimination of 24 of every 25 would be required. With the exceptions of Cuba and Singapore, no published reports of sustained source reduction efforts have achieved anything near these levels of reductions in breeding containers. Practical advice on the use of thresholds is provided for operational control projects.},

The aims of this analysis were (1) to gain insight into the dynamics of infection, with emphasis on the possible role of immunity, and (2) to develop a model that can be used to predict the eﬀects of control. Using the LYMFASIM computer simulation program, two models with diﬀerent types of immunity (anti-L3 larvae or anti-adult worm fecundity) were compared with a model without immunity. Parameters were estimated by ﬁtting the models to data from 5071 individuals with microﬁlaria-density measurement before and after cessation of a 5-year vector management programme. A good ﬁt, in particular of the convex shape of the age-prevalence curve, required inclusion of anti-L3 or anti-fecundity immunity in the model. An individual’s immune-responsiveness was found to halve in y10 years after cessation of boosting. Explanation of the large variation in Mf-density required considerable variation between individuals in exposure and immune responsiveness. The mean life-span of the parasite was estimated at about 10 years. For the post-control period, the models predict a further decline in Mf prevalence, which agrees well with observations made 3 and 6 years after cessation of the integrated vector management programme.},

In these initiatives, some types of research commenced as the programs began and proceeded in parallel. Basic laboratory, clinical, and field research all contributed notably to progress made in the viral programs. For each program, vaccine was the lynchpin intervention, but as the programs progressed, research was required to improve vaccine formulations, delivery methods, and immunization schedules. Surveillance was fundamental to all three programs, whilst polio eradication also required improved diagnostic methods to identify asymptomatic infections. Molecular characterization of pathogen isolates strengthened surveillance and allowed insights into the geographic source of infections and their spread. Anthropologic, sociologic, and behavioural research were needed to address cultural and religious beliefs to expand community acceptance. The last phases of elimination and eradication became increasingly difficult, as a nil incidence was approached. Any eradication initiative for malaria must incorporate flexible research agendas that can adapt to changing epidemiologic contingencies and allow planning for posteradication scenarios.},

	abstract = {Despite the availability of many drugs and therapies to treat malaria, many countries' national policies recommend using a single first-line therapy for most clinical malaria cases. To assess whether this is the best strategy for the population as a whole, we designed an evolutionary-epidemiological modeling framework for malaria and compared the benefits of different treatment strategies in the context of resistance evolution. Our results show that the population-wide use of multiple first-line therapies (MFT) against malaria yields a better clinical outcome than using a single therapy or a cycling strategy where therapies are rotated, either on a fixed cycling schedule or when resistance levels or treatment failure become too high. MFT strategies also delay the emergence and slow the fixation of resistant strains (phenotypes), and they allow a larger fraction of the population to be treated without trading off future treatment of cases that may be untreatable because of high resistance levels. Earlier papers have noted that cycling strategies have the disadvantage of creating a less temporally variable environment than MFT strategies, making resistance evolution easier for the parasite. Here, we illustrate a second feature of parasite ecology that impairs the performance of cycling policies, namely, that cycling policies degrade the mean fitness of the parasite population more quickly than MFT policies, making it easier for new resistant types to invade and spread. The clinical benefits of using multiple first-line therapies against malaria suggest that MFT policies should play a key role in malaria elimination and control programs.},

The regular oscillations of the number of cases around the average endemic level has attracted the attention of epidemiologists and mathematicians alike, In particular, the two-year period of measles in some large communities has been the object of many attempts of explanation in terms of deterministic and stochastic models, Soper's [1] deterministic approach produced damped oscillations in contrast to the observations, Bartlett [2] suggested that a stochastic version of Soper's model was more realistic, (See also Bailey [3], Chap, 7.) London and Yorke [4] however were able to obtain undamped oscillations with periods of one and two years using a deterministic model which includes a latent period between the time of infection and the beginning of the infectious period, From their simulations they conclude that the length of the latent period has to be within a small range for the occurrence of biennial outbreaks, Recently, Stirzaker [5] treated this problem from the point of view of the theory of nonlinear oscillations according to which the biennial cycles of measles epidemics could be understood as subharmonic parametric resonance.},

	abstract = {The paper examines non-linear dynamical phenomena in host—parasite interactions by reference to a series of different problems ranging from the impact on transmission of control measures based on vaccination and chemotherapy, to the effects of immunological responses targeted at different stages in a parasite's life-cycle. Throughout, simple mathematical models are employed to aid in interpretation. Analyses reveal that the influence of a defined control measure on the prevalence or intensity of infection, whether vaccination or drug treatment, is non-linearly related to the magnitude of control effort (as defined by the proportion of individuals vaccinated or treated with a drug). Consideration of the relative merits of gametocyte and sporozoite vaccines against malarial parasites suggests that very high levels of cohort immunization will be required to block transmission in endemic areas, with the former type of vaccine being more effective in reducing transmission for a defined level of coverage and the latter being better with respect to a reduction in morbidity. The inclusion of genetic elements in analyses of the transmission of helminth parasites reveals complex non-linear patterns of change in the abundance of different parasite genotypes under selection pressures imposed by either the host immunological defences or the application of chemotherapeutic agents. When resistance genes are present in parasite populations, the degree to which abundance can be suppressed by chemotherapy depends critically on the frequency and intensity of application, with intermediate values of the former being optimal. A more detailed consideration of the impact of immunological defences on parasite population growth within an individual host, by reference to the erythrocytic cycle of malaria, suggests that the effectiveness of a given immunological response is inversely related to the life-expectancy of the target stage in the parasite's developmental cycle.},

	abstract = {Malaria, one of the greatest historical killers of mankind, continues to claim around half a million lives annually, with almost all deaths occurring in children under the age of five living in tropical Africa. The range of this disease is limited by climate to the warmer regions of the globe, and so anthropogenic global warming (and climate change more broadly) now threatens to alter the geographic area for potential malaria transmission, as both the Plasmodium malaria parasite and Anopheles mosquito vector have highly temperature-dependent lifecycles, while the aquatic immature Anopheles habitats are also strongly dependent upon rainfall and local hydrodynamics. A wide variety of process-based (or mechanistic) mathematical models have thus been proposed for the complex, highly nonlinear weather-driven Anopheles lifecycle and malaria transmission dynamics, but have reached somewhat disparate conclusions as to optimum temperatures for transmission, and the possible effect of increasing temperatures upon (potential) malaria distribution, with some projecting a large increase in the area at risk for malaria, but others predicting primarily a shift in the disease’s geographic range. More generally, both global and local environmental changes drove the initial emergence of P. falciparum as a major human pathogen in tropical Africa some 10,000 years ago, and the disease has a long and deep history through the present. It is the goal of this paper to review major aspects of malaria biology, methods for formalizing these into mathematical forms, uncertainties and controversies in proper modeling methodology, and to provide a timeline of some major modeling efforts from the classical works of Sir Ronald Ross and George Macdonald through recent climate-focused modeling studies. Finally, we attempt to place such mathematical work within a broader historical context for the “million-murdering Death” of malaria.},

However, the consequence of source reduction on mosquito oviposition has largely been neglected in evaluations of environment-management programs. Here, by theoretically examining the relationship between the time spent for oviposition and the availability of aquatic habitats, we show that prolonged oviposition cycles induced by source reduction account for a great deal of reductions in the basic reproductive rate of malaria, especially when aquatic habitats are scarce and the mosquito's flight ability is limited. Neglecting this mechanism may lead to substantial underestimation of the impact of source reduction of aquatic habitats on malaria transmission. Our findings suggest that the prolonged duration of the gonotrophic cycle might be one of the important mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of environment-management interventions for malaria control.},

Field-based analyses of malaria transmission have frequently  relied on the prevalence of asexual parasites or gametocytes as proxies for  infectiousness. We now summarize empirical data on human infectiousness from  Africa and Papua New Guinea. Over a wide range of transmission intensities there  is little relationship between the infectiousness of human populations to vector  mosquitoes and mosquito-to-human transmission intensity. We compare these data  with the predictions of a stochastic simulation model of Plasmodium falciparum  epidemiology. This model predicted little variation in the infectiousness of the  human population for entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs) greater than  approximately 10 infectious bites per year, demonstrating that the lack of  relationship between the EIR and the infectious reservoir can be explained  without invoking any effects of acquired transmission-blocking immunity. The near  absence of field data from areas with an EIR {\textless} 10 per year precluded validation  of the model predictions for low EIR values. These results suggest that  interventions reducing mosquito-to-human transmission will have little or no  effect on human infectiousness at the levels of transmission found in most rural  areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Unless very large reductions in transmission can be  achieved, measures to prevent mosquito-to-human transmission need to be  complemented with interventions that reduce the density or infectiousness of  blood stage parasites.},

The simulated campaign incorporated modestly effective vaccine coverage, bed net  use, and larval control. The results indicate that such campaigns would reduce  EIRs at all four sites by 30- to 50-fold. Even without the vaccine, 15- to  25-fold reductions of EIR were predicted, implying that integrated control with a  few modestly effective tools can meaningfully reduce malaria transmission in a  range of endemic settings. The model accurately predicts the effects of bed nets  and indoor spraying and demonstrates that they are the most effective tools  available for reducing EIR. However, the impact of domestic adult vector control  is amplified by measures for reducing the rate of emergence of vectors or the  level of infectiousness of the human reservoir. We conclude that available tools,  including currently neglected methods for larval control, can reduce malaria  transmission intensity enough to alleviate mortality. Integrated control programs  should be implemented to the fullest extent possible, even in areas of intense  transmission, using simple models as decision-making tools. However, we also  conclude that to eliminate malaria in many areas of intense transmission is  beyond the scope of methods which developing nations can currently afford. New,  cost-effective, practical tools are needed if malaria is ever to be eliminated  from highly endemic areas.},

Many mathematical models of malaria have been developed during the past  century, and applied to potential interventions. However, malaria remains  uncontrolled and is increasing in many areas, as are vector and parasite  resistance to insecticides and drugs. METHODS: This study presents a simulation  model of African malaria vectors. This individual-based model incorporates  current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying Anopheles population dynamics and  their relations to the environment. One of its main strengths is that it is based  on both biological and environmental variables. RESULTS: The model made it  possible to structure existing knowledge, assembled in a comprehensive review of  the literature, and also pointed out important aspects of basic Anopheles biology  about which knowledge is lacking. One simulation showed several patterns similar  to those seen in the field, and made it possible to examine different analyses  and hypotheses for these patterns; sensitivity analyses on temperature, moisture,  predation and preliminary investigations of nutrient competition were also  conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Although based on some mathematical formulae and  parameters, this new tool has been developed in order to be as explicit as  possible, transparent in use, close to reality and amenable to direct use by  field workers. It allows a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying  Anopheles population dynamics in general and also a better understanding of the  dynamics in specific local geographic environments. It points out many important  areas for new investigations that will be critical to effective, efficient,  sustainable interventions.},

In particular, they are parameterizable from quantities we can estimate such as the force of infection (FOI), the rate of natural recovery from a single infection, the treatment rate, and the rate of demographic turnover. However, malaria parasites can superinfect their host which has the effect of increasing the duration of infection before total recovery. Queueing theory has been applied to capture this behavior, but a problem with current queueing models is the exclusion of factors such as demographic turnover and treatment. These factors in particular can affect the entire shape of the distribution of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) generated by the superinfection process, its transient dynamics, and the population mean recovery rate. Here we show the distribution of MOI can be described by an alternative hyper-Poisson distribution. We then couple our resulting equations to a simple vector transmission model, extending previous Ross-Macdonald theory.},

	abstract = {Acquisition of partially protective immunity is a dominant feature of the epidemiology of malaria among exposed individuals. The processes that determine the acquisition of immunity to clinical disease and to asymptomatic carriage of malaria parasites are poorly understood, in part because of a lack of validated immunological markers of protection. Using mathematical models, we seek to better understand the processes that determine observed epidemiological patterns. We have developed an age-structured mathematical model of malaria transmission in which acquired immunity can act in three ways (“immunity functions”): reducing the probability of clinical disease, speeding the clearance of parasites, and increasing tolerance to subpatent infections. Each immunity function was allowed to vary in efficacy depending on both age and malaria transmission intensity. The results were compared to age patterns of parasite prevalence and clinical disease in endemic settings in northeastern Tanzania and The Gambia. Two types of immune function were required to reproduce the epidemiological age-prevalence curves seen in the empirical data; a form of clinical immunity that reduces susceptibility to clinical disease and develops with age and exposure (with half-life of the order of five years or more) and a form of anti-parasite immunity which results in more rapid clearance of parasitaemia, is acquired later in life and is longer lasting (half-life of {\textgreater}20 y). The development of anti-parasite immunity better reproduced observed epidemiological patterns if it was dominated by age-dependent physiological processes rather than by the magnitude of exposure (provided some exposure occurs). Tolerance to subpatent infections was not required to explain the empirical data. The model comprising immunity to clinical disease which develops early in life and is exposure-dependent, and anti-parasite immunity which develops later in life and is not dependent on the magnitude of exposure, appears to best reproduce the pattern of parasite prevalence and clinical disease by age in different malaria transmission settings. Understanding the effector mechanisms underlying these two immune functions will assist in the design of transmission-reducing interventions against malaria.},

The role of climate change in the exacerbation of the disease has been controversial, and the specific influence of rising temperature (warming) has been highly debated following a previous study reporting no evidence to support a trend in temperature. We revisit this result using the same temperature data, now updated to the present from 1950 to 2002 for four high-altitude sites in East Africa where malaria has become a serious public health problem. With both nonparametric and parametric statistical analyses, we find evidence for a significant warming trend at all sites. To assess the biological significance of this trend, we drive a dynamical model for the population dynamics of the mosquito vector with the temperature time series and the corresponding detrended versions. This approach suggests that the observed temperature changes would be significantly amplified by the mosquito population dynamics with a difference in the biological response at least 1 order of magnitude larger than that in the environmental variable. Our results emphasize the importance of considering not just the statistical significance of climate trends but also their biological implications with dynamical models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard advice regarding vector control is to prefer interventions that reduce the lifespan of adult mosquitoes. The basis for this advice is a decades-old sensitivity analysis of 'vectorial capacity', a concept relevant for most malaria transmission models and based solely on adult mosquito population dynamics. Recent advances in micro-simulation models offer an opportunity to expand the theory of vectorial capacity to include both adult and juvenile mosquito stages in the model.
METHODS: In this study we revisit arguments about transmission and its sensitivity to mosquito bionomic parameters using an elasticity analysis of developed formulations of vectorial capacity.
RESULTS: We show that reducing adult survival has effects on both adult and juvenile population size, which are significant for transmission and not accounted for in traditional formulations of vectorial capacity. The elasticity of these effects is dependent on various mosquito population parameters, which we explore. Overall, control is most sensitive to methods that affect adult mosquito mortality rates, followed by blood feeding frequency, human blood feeding habit, and lastly, to adult mosquito population density.
CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasise more strongly than ever the sensitivity of transmission to adult mosquito mortality, but also suggest the high potential of combinations of interventions including larval source management. This must be done with caution, however, as policy requires a more careful consideration of costs, operational difficulties and policy goals in relation to baseline transmission.},

	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity and long-distance translocation (LDT) play important roles in the spatio-temporal dynamics and management of emerging infectious diseases and invasive species. We assessed the influence of LDT events on the invasive spread of raccoon rabies through Connecticut. We identified several putative LDT events, and developed a network-model to evaluate whether they became new foci for epidemic spread. LDT was fairly common, but many of the LDTs were isolated events that did not spread. Two putative LDT events did appear to become nascent foci that affected the epidemic in surrounding townships. In evaluating the role of LDT, we simultaneously revisited the problem of spatial heterogeneity. The spread of raccoon rabies is associated with forest cover--rabies moves up to three-times slower through the most heavily forested townships compared with those with less forestation. Forestation also modified the effect of rivers. In the best overall model, rabies did not cross the river separating townships that were heavily forested, and the spread slowed substantially between townships that were lightly forested. Our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity can be used to enhance the effects of rabies control by focusing vaccine bait distribution along rivers in lightly forested areas. LDT events are a concern, but this analysis suggests that at a local scale they can be isolated and managed.},

	abstract = {Local and cross-border importation remain major challenges to malaria elimination and are difficult to measure using traditional surveillance data. To address this challenge, we systematically collected parasite genetic data and travel history from thousands of malaria cases across northeastern Namibia and estimated human mobility from mobile phone data. We observed strong fine-scale spatial structure in local parasite populations, providing positive evidence that the majority of cases were due to local transmission. This result was largely consistent with estimates from mobile phone and travel history data. However, genetic data identified more detailed and extensive evidence of parasite connectivity over hundreds of kilometers than the other data, within Namibia and across the Angolan and Zambian borders. Our results provide a framework for incorporating genetic data into malaria surveillance and provide evidence that both strengthening of local interventions and regional coordination are likely necessary to eliminate malaria in this region of Southern Africa., The number of malaria cases has dropped in some Southern Africa countries, but others still remain seriously affected. When people travel within and between countries, they can bring the parasites that cause the disease to different areas. This can fuel local transmission or even lead to outbreaks in a malaria-free area., When new malaria patients are diagnosed, they are often asked to report their recent travel history, so that the origin of their infection can be tracked. In theory, this would help to spot regions where the disease is imported from, and design targeted interventions., However, it is difficult to know exactly where the parasites come from based on self-disclosed travel history. At best, this history can provide information about that persons infection but nothing further in the past; at worst this history can be completely incorrect. Parasite DNA, on the other hand, has the potential to bring with it an indelible record of the past. To address the problem of determining where malaria infections came from, Tessema, Wesolowski et al. focused on Northern Namibia, a region where malaria persists despite being practically absent from the rest of the country. Patients movements were assessed using mobile phone call records as well as self-reported travel history In addition, samples a single drop of blood were taken so that the genetic information of the parasites could be examined., Combining genetic data with travel history and phone records, Tessema, Wesolowski et al. found that, in Northern Namibia, most people had gotten infected by malaria locally. However, the genetic analyses also revealed that certain infections came from places across the Angolan and Zambian borders, information that was much more difficult to obtain using self-report or mobile phone data. A new, separate study by Chang et al. also supports these results, showing that, in Bangladesh, combining genetic data with travel history and mobile phone records helps to track how malaria spreads., Overall, the work by Tessema, Wesolowski et al. indicate that, in Northern Namibia, it will be necessary to strengthen local interventions to eliminate malaria. However, different countries in the region may also need to coordinate to decrease malaria nearby and reduce the number of cases coming into the country. While genetic data can help to monitor how new malaria cases are imported, this knowledge will be most valuable if it is routinely collected across countries. New tools will also be required to translate genetic data into information that can easily be used for control and elimination programs.},

	abstract = {Humans move frequently and tend to carry parasites among areas with endemic malaria and into areas where local transmission is unsustainable. Human-mediated parasite mobility can thus sustain parasite populations in areas where they would otherwise be absent. Data describing human mobility and malaria epidemiology can help classify landscapes into parasite demographic sources and sinks, ecological concepts that have parallels in malaria control discussions of transmission foci. By linking transmission to parasite flow, it is possible to stratify landscapes for malaria control and elimination, as sources are disproportionately important to the regional persistence of malaria parasites. Here, we identify putative malaria sources and sinks for pre-elimination Namibia using malaria parasite rate (PR) maps and call data records from mobile phones, using a steady-state analysis of a malaria transmission model to infer where infections most likely occurred. We also examined how the landscape of transmission and burden changed from the pre-elimination setting by comparing the location and extent of predicted pre-elimination transmission foci with modeled incidence for 2009. This comparison suggests that while transmission was spatially focal pre-elimination, the spatial distribution of cases changed as burden declined. The changing spatial distribution of burden could be due to importation, with cases focused around importation hotspots, or due to heterogeneous application of elimination effort. While this framework is an important step towards understanding progressive changes in malaria distribution and the role of subnational transmission dynamics in a policy-relevant way, future work should account for international parasite movement, utilize real time surveillance data, and relax the steady state assumption required by the presented model., For countries considering pursuing malaria elimination, understanding where malaria transmission occurs is crucial for intervention planning. By identifying the areas that act as sources of malaria parasites, elimination programs can target efforts to end local transmission and achieve nationwide elimination. Mapping parasite sources requires a modeling framework that integrates malaria burden and human movement information, however, as human mobility facilitates parasite spread and drives source-sink disease dynamics. In this study, we present a mathematical model that can be used to identify areas with self-sustaining malaria transmission when analyzed at equilibrium. We demonstrate how this method can inform elimination planning for countries with stable low transmission using data from Namibia. The maps of sources and sinks created using this method can be used to direct policy and target areas with self-sustaining malaria transmission in countries with stable transmission. Finally, we compare the predicted extent of transmission foci with more recent maps of incidence, to determine whether local transmission likely retreated into focal areas and the potential importance of importation.},

	abstract = {Background
Malaria remains a problem for many countries classified as malaria free through cases imported from endemic regions. Imported cases to non-endemic countries often result in delays in diagnosis, are expensive to treat, and can sometimes cause secondary local transmission. The movement of malaria in endemic countries has also contributed to the spread of drug resistance and threatens long-term eradication goals. Here we focused on quantifying the international movements of malaria to improve our understanding of these phenomena and facilitate the design of mitigation strategies.
Methods
In this meta-analysis, we studied the database of publicly available nationally reported statistics on imported malaria in the past 10 years, covering more than 50 000 individual cases. We obtained data from 40 non-endemic countries and recorded the geographical variations.
Findings
Infection movements were strongly skewed towards a small number of high-traffic routes between 2005 and 2015, with the west Africa region accounting for 56\% (13 947/24 941) of all imported cases to non-endemic countries with a reported travel destination, and France and the UK receiving the highest number of cases, with more than 4000 reported cases per year on average. Countries strongly linked by movements of imported cases are grouped by historical, language, and travel ties. There is strong spatial clustering of plasmodium species types.
Interpretation
The architecture of the air network, historical ties, demographics of travellers, and malaria endemicity contribute to highly heterogeneous patterns of numbers, routes, and species compositions of parasites transported. With global malaria eradication on the international agenda, malaria control altering local transmission, and the threat of drug resistance, understanding these patterns and their drivers is increasing in importance.

	abstract = {The tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia) is the first licensed vaccine against dengue, but recent findings indicate an elevated risk of severe disease among vaccinees without prior dengue virus (DENV) exposure. The World Health Organization currently recommends CYD-TDV only for individuals with serological confirmation of past DENV exposure. Our objective was to evaluate the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination following serological screening. To do so, we used an agent-based model to simulate DENV transmission with and without vaccination over a 10-year timeframe. Across a range of values for the proportion of vaccinees with prior DENV exposure, we projected the proportion of symptomatic and hospitalized cases averted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of serological screening. Scenarios about the cost-effectiveness of screening and vaccination were chosen to be representative of Brazil and the Philippines. We found that public health impact depended primarily on sensitivity in high-transmission settings and on specificity in low-transmission settings. Cost-effectiveness could be achievable from the perspective of a public payer provided that sensitivity and the value of a disability-adjusted life-year were both high, but only in high-transmission settings. Requirements for reducing relative risk and achieving cost-effectiveness from an individual perspective were more restricted, due to the fact that those who test negative pay for screening but receive no benefit. Our results predict that cost-effectiveness could be achieved only in high-transmission areas of dengue-endemic countries with a relatively high per capita GDP, such as Panamá (13,680 USD), Brazil (8,649 USD), México (8,201 USD), or Thailand (5,807 USD). In conclusion, vaccination with CYD-TDV following serological screening could have a positive impact in some high-transmission settings, provided that screening is highly specific (to minimize individual harm), at least moderately sensitive (to maximize population benefit), and sufficiently inexpensive (depending on the setting).},

Detailed information about human movements during outbreaks are, however, difficult to obtain and may not be available during future epidemics. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa between 2014–16 demonstrated how quickly pathogens can spread to large urban centers following one cross-species transmission event. Here we describe a flexible transmission model to test the utility of generalised human movement models in estimating EVD cases and spatial spread over the course of the outbreak. A transmission model that includes a general model of human mobility significantly improves prediction of EVD’s incidence compared to models without this component. Human movement plays an important role not only to ignite the epidemic in locations previously disease free, but over the course of the entire epidemic. We also demonstrate important differences between countries in population mixing and the improved prediction attributable to movement metrics. Given their relative rareness, locally derived mobility data are unlikely to exist in advance of future epidemics or pandemics. Our findings show that transmission patterns derived from general human movement models can improve forecasts of spatio-temporal transmission patterns in places where local mobility data is unavailable.},

Here, we fitted a mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time-series data from Pakistan and compared maximum-likelihood estimates of ‘mixing parameters’ when disaggregating data across an urban–rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to differences in mixing. Accounting for differences in mobility by incorporating two fine-scale, density-dependent covariate layers eliminates differences in mixing but results in a doubling of the estimated transmission potential of the large urban district of Lahore. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines or other interventions. We complement this analysis with estimates of the relationships between dengue transmission intensity and other putative environmental drivers thereof.},

We used detailed clinical and entomological data from parallel cohort studies conducted across the malaria transmission spectrum in Uganda to quantify the development of immunity against symptomatic P. falciparum as a function of age and transmission intensity. We focus on: anti-parasite immunity (i.e. ability to control parasite densities) and anti-disease immunity (i.e. ability to tolerate higher parasite densities without fever). Our findings suggest a strong effect of age on both types of immunity, not explained by cumulative-exposure. They also show an independent effect of exposure, where children living in moderate/high transmission settings develop immunity faster as transmission increases. Surprisingly, children in the lowest transmission setting appear to develop immunity more efficiently than those living in moderate transmission settings. Anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity develop in parallel, reducing the probability of experiencing symptomatic malaria upon each subsequent P. falciparum infection.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Heterogeneity in malaria transmission has household, temporal, and spatial components. These factors are relevant for improving the efficiency of malaria control by targeting heterogeneity. To quantify variation, we analyzed mosquito counts from entomological surveillance conducted at three study sites in Uganda that varied in malaria transmission intensity. Mosquito biting or exposure is a risk factor for malaria transmission.
            
            
              Methods:
              Using a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model, validated via a comprehensive simulation study, we quantified household differences in malaria vector density and examined its spatial distribution. We introduced a novel approach for identifying changes in vector abundance hotspots over time by computing the Getis-Ord statistic on ratios of household biting propensities for different scenarios. We also explored the association of household biting propensities with housing and environmental covariates.
            
            
              Results:
              In each site, there was evidence for hot and cold spots of vector abundance, and spatial patterns associated with urbanicity, elevation, or other environmental covariates. We found some differences in the hotspots in rainy vs. dry seasons or before vs. after the application of control interventions. Housing quality explained a portion of the variation among households in mosquito counts.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              This work provided an improved understanding of heterogeneity in malaria vector density at the three study sites in Uganda and offered a valuable opportunity for assessing whether interventions could be spatially targeted to be aimed at abundance hotspots which may increase malaria risk. Indoor residual spraying was shown to be a successful measure of vector control interventions in Tororo, Uganda.  Cement walls, brick floors, closed eaves, screened airbricks, and tiled roofs were features of a house that had shown reduction of household biting propensity. Improvements in house quality should be recommended as a supplementary measure for malaria control reducing risk of infection.},

	abstract = {An important question for mosquito population dynamics, mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and vector control is how mosquito populations are regulated. Here we develop simple models with heterogeneity in egg laying patterns and in the responses of larval populations to crowding in aquatic habitats. We use the models to evaluate how such heterogeneity affects mosquito population regulation and the effects of larval source management (LSM). We revisit the notion of a carrying capacity and show how heterogeneity changes our understanding of density dependence and the outcome of LSM. Crowding in and productivity of aquatic habitats is highly uneven unless egg-laying distributions are fine-tuned to match the distribution of habitats’ carrying capacities. LSM reduces mosquito population density linearly with coverage if adult mosquitoes avoid laying eggs in treated habitats, but quadratically if eggs are laid in treated habitats and the effort is therefore wasted (i.e., treating 50\% of habitat reduces mosquito density by approximately 75\%). Unsurprisingly, targeting (i.e. treating a subset of the most productive pools) gives much larger reductions for similar coverage, but with poor targeting, increasing coverage could increase adult mosquito population densities if eggs are laid in higher capacity habitats. Our analysis suggests that, in some contexts, LSM models that accounts for heterogeneity in production of adult mosquitoes provide theoretical support for pursuing mosquito-borne disease prevention through strategic and repeated application of modern larvicides.},

Growing evidence shows that Plasmodium vivax malaria is clinically less benign than has been commonly believed. In addition, it is the most widely distributed species of human malaria and is likely to cause more illness in certain regions than the more extensively studied P. falciparum malaria. Understanding where P. vivax transmission exists and measuring the number of people who live at risk of infection is a fundamental first step to estimating the global disease toll. The aim of this paper is to generate a reliable map of the worldwide distribution of this parasite and to provide an estimate of how many people are exposed to probable infection. A geographical information system was used to map data on the presence of P. vivax infection and spatial information on climatic conditions that impede transmission (low ambient temperature and extremely arid environments) in order to delineate areas where transmission was unlikely to take place. This map was combined with population distribution data to estimate how many people live in these areas and are, therefore, exposed to risk of infection by P. vivax malaria. The results show that 2.85 billion people were exposed to some level of risk of transmission in 2009.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cholera is an ancient disease that continues to cause epidemic and pandemic disease despite ongoing efforts to limit its spread. Mathematical models provide one means of assessing the utility of various proposed interventions. However, cholera models that have been developed to date have had limitations, suggesting that there are basic elements of cholera transmission that we still do not understand. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recent laboratory findings suggest that passage of Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba El Tor through the gastrointestinal tract results in a short-lived, hyperinfectious state of the organism that decays in a matter of hours into a state of lower infectiousness. Incorporation of this hyperinfectious state into our disease model provides a much better fit with the observed epidemic pattern of cholera. These findings help to substantiate the clinical relevance of laboratory observations regarding the hyperinfectious state, and underscore the critical importance of human-to-human versus environment-to-human transmission in the generation of epidemic and pandemic disease. CONCLUSIONS: To have maximal impact on limiting epidemic spread of cholera, interventions should be targeted toward minimizing risk of transmission of the short-lived, hyperinfectious form of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. The possibility of comparable hyperinfectious states in other major epidemic diseases also needs to be evaluated and, as appropriate, incorporated into models of disease prevention.},

	abstract = {Rabies is an important public health concern in North America because of recent epidemics of a rabies virus variant associated with raccoons. The costs associated with surveillance, diagnostic testing, and post-exposure treatment of humans exposed to rabies have fostered coordinated efforts to control rabies spread by distributing an oral rabies vaccine to wild raccoons. Authorities have tried to contain westward expansion of the epidemic front of raccoon-associated rabies via a vaccine corridor established in counties of eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Although sporadic cases of rabies have been identified in Ohio since oral rabies vaccine distribution in 1998, the first evidence of a significant breach in this vaccine corridor was not detected until 2004 in Lake County, Ohio. Herein, we forecast the spatial spread of rabies in Ohio from this breach using a stochastic spatial model that was first developed for exploratory data analysis in Connecticut and next used to successfully hind-cast wave-front dynamics of rabies spread across New York. The projections, based on expansion from the Lake County breach, are strongly affected by the spread of rabies by rare, but unpredictable long-distance translocation of rabid raccoons; rabies may traverse central Ohio at a rate 2.5-fold greater than previously analyzed wildlife epidemics. Using prior estimates of the impact of local heterogeneities on wave-front propagation and of the time lag between surveillance-based detection of an initial rabies case to full-blown epidemic, specific regions within the state are identified for vaccine delivery and expanded surveillance effort.},

	abstract = {Rabies control in terrestrial wildlife reservoirs relies heavily on an oral rabies vaccine (ORV). In addition to direct ORV delivery to protect wildlife in natural habitats, vaccine corridors have been constructed to control the spread; these corridors are often developed around natural barriers, such as rivers, to enhance the effectiveness of vaccine deployment. However, the question of how to optimally deploy ORV around a river (or other natural barrier) to best exploit the barrier for rabies control has not been addressed using mathematical models. Given an advancing epidemic wave, should the vaccine be distributed on both sides of barrier, behind the barrier, or in front of it? Here, we introduce a new mathematical model for the dynamics of raccoon rabies on a spatially heterogeneous landscape that is both simple and realistic. We demonstrate that the vaccine should always be deployed behind a barrier to minimize the recurrence of subsequent epidemics. Although the oral rabies vaccine is sufficient to induce herd immunity inside the vaccinated area, it simultaneously creates a demographic refuge. When that refuge is in front of a natural barrier, seasonal dispersal from the vaccine corridor into an endemic region sustains epidemic oscillations of raccoon rabies. When the vaccine barrier creates a refuge behind the river, the low permeability of the barrier to host movement limits dispersal of the host population from the protected populations into the rabies endemic area and limits subsequent rabies epidemics.},

Methods are needed to monitor genetic diversity in polymorphic vaccine antigens, but determining which genetic variants of such antigens are present in infected individuals is complicated by the frequent occurrence of mixed infections. METHODS: Pyrosequencing was used to determine allele frequencies at each of six single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage vaccine antigen merozoite surface protein 1 19 kDa (MSP-119) in field samples from a vaccine-testing site in Mali. Mixtures of MSP-119 clones were created to validate a haplotype-estimating algorithm that uses maximum likelihood methods to determine the most probable combination of haplotypes given the allele frequencies for an infection and the haplotypes known to be circulating in the population. RESULTS: Fourteen unique MSP-119 haplotypes were identified among 351 genotyped infections. After adjustment to a standard curve, Pyrosequencing provided accurate and precise estimates of allele frequencies in mixed infections. The haplotype-estimating algorithm provided accurate estimates of haplotypes in mixed infections containing up to three haplotypes. Based on the MSP-119 locus, approximately 90\% of the 351 infections contained two or fewer haplotypes. CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing in conjunction with a haplotype-estimating algorithm provides accurate estimates of haplotypes present in infections with up to 3 haplotypes, and can be used to monitor genetic diversity in parasite populations prior to and following introduction of MSP-1-based malaria vaccines.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Recent increases in funding for malaria control have led to the reduction in transmission in many malaria endemic countries, prompting the national control programmes of 36 malaria endemic countries to set elimination targets. Accounting for human population movement (HPM) in planning for control, elimination and post-elimination surveillance is important, as evidenced by previous elimination attempts that were undermined by the reintroduction of malaria through HPM. Strategic control and elimination planning, therefore, requires quantitative information on HPM patterns and the translation of these into parasite dispersion. HPM patterns and the risk of malaria vary substantially across spatial and temporal scales, demographic and socioeconomic sub-groups, and motivation for travel, so multiple data sets are likely required for quantification of movement. While existing studies based on mobile phone call record data combined with malaria transmission maps have begun to address within-country HPM patterns, other aspects remain poorly quantified despite their importance in accurately gauging malaria movement patterns and building control and detection strategies, such as cross-border HPM, demographic and socioeconomic stratification of HPM patterns, forms of transport, personal malaria protection and other factors that modify malaria risk. A wealth of data exist to aid filling these gaps, which, when combined with spatial data on transport infrastructure, traffic and malaria transmission, can answer relevant questions to guide strategic planning. This review aims to (i) discuss relevant types of HPM across spatial and temporal scales, (ii) document where datasets exist to quantify HPM, (iii) highlight where data gaps remain and (iv) briefly put forward methods for integrating these datasets in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) framework for analysing and modelling human population and Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection movements.},

To determine their magnitude and geographical distribution, and explore associated risk factors, we examined national surveillance data from 1991 to 2001 and potential ecological determinants. Average annual incidence rates were calculated and mapped for each province. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were used to explore associations with selected environmental and human risk factors. Overall, shigellosis rates per 100,000 population (median, 41; mean, 70) were higher and more widespread than rates for typhoid fever (median, 7; mean, 23) and cholera (median, 0.3; mean, 2.7). Shigellosis was highest in the Central Highlands and was significantly associated with rainfall and urban poverty; typhoid fever prevailed in the Mekong River Delta and was most associated with vapor pressure and river/stream drinking water; and cholera predominated along the Central Coastal regions and correlated positively with rainfall and public well drinking water. The distinct geographical patterns of each disease appear to be driven by a combination of different ecological factors.},

However, many countries considering elimination nowadays have high intrinsic transmission potential and, without the support of a regional campaign, have to deal with the constant threat of imported cases of the disease, emphasising the need to revisit the strategies on which contemporary elimination programmes are based. To eliminate malaria, programmes need to concentrate on identification and elimination of foci of infections through both passive and active methods of case detection. This approach needs appropriate treatment of both clinical cases and asymptomatic infections, combined with targeted vector control. Draining of infectious pools entirely will not be sufficient since they could be replenished by imported malaria. Elimination will thus additionally need identification and treatment of incoming infections before they lead to transmission, or, more realistically, embarking on regional initiatives to dry up importation at its source.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of asymptomatic individuals, regardless of their malaria infection status, with regularly spaced therapeutic doses of antimalarial drugs has been proposed as a method for reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. This strategy, called intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), is currently employed for pregnant women and is being studied for infants (IPTi) as well. As with any drug-based intervention strategy, it is important to understand how implementation may affect the spread of drug-resistant parasites. This is a difficult issue to address experimentally because of the limited size and duration of IPTi trials as well as the intractability of distinguishing the spread of resistance due to conventional treatment of malaria episodes versus that due to IPTi when the same drug is used in both contexts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using a mathematical model, we evaluated the possible impact of treating individuals with antimalarial drugs at regular intervals regardless of their infection status. We translated individual treatment strategies and drug pharmacokinetics into parasite population dynamic effects and show that immunity, treatment rate, drug decay kinetics, and presumptive treatment rate are important factors in the spread of drug-resistant parasites. Our model predicts that partially resistant parasites are more likely to spread in low-transmission areas, but fully resistant parasites are more likely to spread under conditions of high transmission, which is consistent with some epidemiological observations. We were also able to distinguish between spread of resistance due to treatment of symptomatic infections and that due to IPTi. We showed that IPTi could accelerate the spread of resistant parasites, but this effect was only likely to be significant in areas of low or unstable transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here demonstrate the importance of considering both the half-life of a drug and the existing level of resistance when choosing a drug for IPTi. Drugs to which little or no resistance exists are not advisable for IPT in high-transmission areas, but IPTi is not likely to significantly impact the spread of highly resistant parasites in areas where partial resistance is already established. IPTi is more likely to accelerate the spread of resistance in high-transmission areas than is IPT in adults (i.e., pregnant women).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The efficient allocation of financial resources for malaria control using appropriate combinations of interventions requires accurate information on the geographic distribution of malaria risk. An evidence-based description of the global range of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and its endemicity has not been assembled in almost 40 y. This paper aims to define the global geographic distribution of P. falciparum malaria in 2007 and to provide a preliminary description of its transmission intensity within this range. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The global spatial distribution of P. falciparum malaria was generated using nationally reported case-incidence data, medical intelligence, and biological rules of transmission exclusion, using temperature and aridity limits informed by the bionomics of dominant Anopheles vector species. A total of 4,278 spatially unique cross-sectional survey estimates of P. falciparum parasite rates were assembled. Extractions from a population surface showed that 2.37 billion people lived in areas at any risk of P. falciparum transmission in 2007. Globally, almost 1 billion people lived under unstable, or extremely low, malaria risk. Almost all P. falciparum parasite rates above 50\% were reported in Africa in a latitude band consistent with the distribution of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Conditions of low parasite prevalence were also common in Africa, however. Outside of Africa, P. falciparum malaria prevalence is largely hypoendemic (less than 10\%), with the median below 5\% in the areas surveyed. CONCLUSIONS: This new map is a plausible representation of the current extent of P. falciparum risk and the most contemporary summary of the population at risk of P. falciparum malaria within these limits. For 1 billion people at risk of unstable malaria transmission, elimination is epidemiologically feasible, and large areas of Africa are more amenable to control than appreciated previously. The release of this information in the public domain will help focus future resources for P. falciparum malaria control and elimination.},

This epidemic expansion probably resulted from a single source after a lateral gene transfer (LGT) event that changed the serotype of an epidemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain to O139. However, some studies found substantial genetic diversity, perhaps caused by multiple origins. To further explore the relatedness of O139 strains, we analyzed nine sequenced loci from 96 isolates from patients at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Calcutta, from 1992 to 2000. We found 64 novel alleles distributed among 51 sequence types. LGT events produced three times the number of nucleotide changes compared to mutation. In contrast to the traditional concept of epidemic spread of a homogeneous clone, the establishment of variant alleles generated by LGT during the rapid expansion of a clonal bacterial population may be a paradigm in infections and epidemics.},

RESULTS: In each year, temperatures of patients with mixed Plasmodium vivax-Plasmodium falciparum infections were higher than temperatures of patients with P. vivax or P. falciparum infections. In every mixed-species case, P. falciparum parasitemia was higher than P. vivax parasitemia, but patient temperature was not correlated with the parasitemia of either species or with the total parasitemia. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults who self-report to malaria clinics in western Thailand, patients with mixed P. vivax-P. falciparum infections have higher fevers than patients with single-species infections, a distinction that cannot be attributed to differences in parasitemia.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: No simple, cost-effective methods exist to identify patients at high risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci colonization outside intensive care settings. Without such methods, colonized patients are entering hospitals undetected and transmitting these bacteria to other patients. We aimed to develop a highly sensitive, simple-to-administer prediction rule to identify subpopulations of patients at high risk for colonization on hospital admission. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to the general medical and surgical wards of a tertiary-care facility. Data were collected using electronic medical records and an investigator-administered questionnaire. Cultures of anterior nares and the perirectal area were also collected within 48 hours of admission. RESULTS: Among 699 patients who enrolled in this study, 697 underwent nasal cultures; 555, perirectal cultures; and 553, both. Patient self-report of a hospital admission in the previous year was the most sensitive variable in identifying patients colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or with either organism (sensitivity, 76\% and 90\%, respectively). A prediction rule requiring patients to self-report having received antibiotics and a hospital admission in the previous year would have identified 100\% of patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. In the high-risk groups defined by the prediction rule, the prevalence of colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, or either organism were 8.1\%, 10.2\%, and 15.0\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with a self-reported previous admission within 1 year may represent a high-risk group for colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterococci at hospital admission and should be considered for targeted active surveillance culturing.},

The results helped define the minimum information requirements for mapping infectious disease occurrence, and a quantitative framework for assessing the mapping opportunities for all infectious diseases. This revealed that of 355 infectious diseases identified, 174 (49\%) have a strong rationale for mapping and of these only 7 (4\%) had been comprehensively mapped. A variety of ambitions, such as the quantification of the global burden of infectious disease, international biosurveillance, assessing the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks and exploring the propensity for infectious disease evolution and emergence, are limited by these omissions. An overview of the factors hindering progress in disease cartography is provided. It is argued that rapid improvement in the landscape of infectious diseases mapping can be made by embracing non-conventional data sources, automation of geo-positioning and mapping procedures enabled by machine learning and information technology, respectively, in addition to harnessing labour of the volunteer ‘cognitive surplus’ through crowdsourcing.},

These waves often become distorted through their interaction with environmental and population heterogeneities and by long-distance translocation of infected individuals. Accurate a priori predictions of travelling waves of infection depend upon understanding and quantifying these distorting factors. We assess the effects of anisotropies arising from the orientation of rivers in relation to the direction of disease-front propagation and the damming effect of mountains on disease movement in natural populations. The model successfully predicts the local and large-scale prevaccination spread of raccoon rabies through New York State, based on a previous spatially heterogeneous model of raccoon-rabies invasion across the state of Connecticut. Use of this model provides a rare example of a priori prediction of an epidemic invasion over a naturally heterogeneous landscape. Model predictions matched to data can also be used to evaluate the most likely points of disease introduction. These results have general implications for predicting future pathogen invasions and evaluating potential containment strategies.},

Fit to data from the recent epidemic in the Netherlands, we evaluate the efficacy of control strategies and forecast avian influenza dynamics. Our results identify high-risk areas of spread by mapping of the farm level reproductive number. Results suggest that an immediate depopulation of infected flocks following an accurate and quick diagnosis would have a greater impact than simply depopulating surrounding flocks. Understanding the relative importance of different control measures is essential for response planning.},

	abstract = {The increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance in hospital-acquired infections is a major public health concern that has both biological and economic causes. Here we develop conceptual mathematical models that couple the economic incentives and population biology of hospital infection control (HIC). We show that the optimal investment by a hospital for HIC changes with the proportion of patients already colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) at the time of admission. As that proportion increases, the optimal behavior of a hospital is to increase spending to control ARB with low transmissibility and decrease spending on those with high transmissibility. In some cases, the global optimum investment in HIC can shift discontinuously from one that contains transmission to a do-nothing policy once the proportion already colonized at the time of admission becomes too great. We also show that investments in HIC are determined by a strategic game when several hospitals share patients. Hospitals acting selfishly and rationally will free-ride on the investments of other hospitals, and the level of free-riding should increase with the number of other hospitals in the area. Thus, in areas with many hospitals, the rational strategy for each hospital is to spend less than in areas with few hospitals. Thus, we predict that transmission rates and the prevalence of ARB should be higher in urban hospitals, for instance, compared with rural hospitals. We conclude that regional coordination and planning for HIC is an essential element of public health planning for hospital-acquired infections.},

Infections with ARB are most common in the intensive care units of tertiary-care hospitals, but the underlying cause of the increases may be a steady increase in the number of asymptomatic carriers entering hospitals. Carriers may shed ARB for years but remain undetected, transmitting ARB to others as they move among hospitals, long-term care facilities, and the community. We apply structured population models to explore the dynamics of ARB, addressing the following questions: (i) What is the relationship between the proportion of carriers admitted to a hospital, transmission, and the risk of infection with ARB? (ii) How do frequently hospitalized patients contribute to epidemics of ARB? (iii) How do transmission in the community, long-term care facilities, and hospitals interact to determine the proportion of the population that is carrying ARB? We offer an explanation for why ARB epidemics have fast and slow phases and why resistance may continue to increase despite infection-control efforts. To successfully manage ARB at tertiary-care hospitals, regional coordination of infection control may be necessary, including tracking asymptomatic carriers through health-care systems.},

Beginning in August 2008, a major cholera epidemic occurred in Zimbabwe, with 98,585 reported cases and 4,287 deaths. The dynamics of such outbreaks, particularly in nonestuarine regions, are not well understood. We explored the utility of mathematical models in understanding transmission dynamics of cholera and in assessing the magnitude of interventions necessary to control epidemic disease. Weekly data on reported cholera cases were obtained from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MoHCW) for the period from November 13, 2008 to July 31, 2009. A mathematical model was formulated and fitted to cumulative cholera cases to estimate the basic reproductive numbers R(0) and the partial reproductive numbers from all 10 provinces for the 2008-2009 Zimbabwe cholera epidemic. Estimated basic reproductive numbers were highly heterogeneous, ranging from a low value of just above unity to 2.72. Partial reproductive numbers were also highly heterogeneous, suggesting that the transmission routes varied by province; human-to-human transmission accounted for 41-95\% of all transmission. Our models suggest that the underlying patterns of cholera transmission varied widely from province to province, with a corresponding variation in the amenability of outbreaks in different provinces to control measures such as immunization. These data underscore the heterogeneity of cholera transmission dynamics, potentially linked to differences in environment, socio-economic conditions, and cultural practices. The lack of traditional estuarine reservoirs combined with these estimates of R(0) suggest that mass vaccination against cholera deployed strategically in Zimbabwe and surrounding regions could prevent future cholera epidemics and eventually eliminate cholera from the region.},

In the first method, the median Annual Parasite Incidence (API) was used as the criterion to classify an area as at risk for malaria while in the second method, the API and the Falciparum Rate (FR) were used as the criteria. Risk maps were produced by plotting the results of the analyses on maps generated by EPIMAP. The potential uses of risk maps are discussed.},

	abstract = {Bizadandi block of District Mandla was selected for demonstration of bio-environmental control of malaria. The project presently covers 80 experimental villages and 12 control villages. In this area, because of indifferent surveillance and spraying in the past (from 1978-86) the API was reported low and the parasite reservoir in the community had built up over the years. At the outset of the study the malaria prevalence was high with preponderance of P. falciparum. Densities of A. culicifacies were very high and A. fluviatilis was also present. P. falciparum predominated in both experimental and control area during 1988 than in 1987. Annual blood examination rate (ABER) was 73.6 and 57.5 and annual parasite incidence (API) was 114.7 and 228.0 in experimental and control villages in 1987, while in 1988, ABER and API was 63 and 73 and 112 and 316 in experimental and control, respectively. There was constant stabilization of Pf in neighbouring blocks in 1988 while in experimental areas Pf percentage has come down appreciably during March to June. It is very alarming to note that the parasite reservoir in control villages was sufficient to maintain active transmission even when antimalarial activities are at a peak. The application of residual insecticides like DDT and HCH has no tangible impact on the reduction in vector densities and the transmission of malaria. Even if a replacement insecticide like malathion is used it may produce very limited impact on vector densities in such forested zones. Thus, there is an urgent need to intensify integrated malaria control operations in the area on long term basis.},

Evaluation of coded samples by peptide ELISA provided a framework to estimate the malarial impact. Comparison of field data and ELISA OD values in different malariogenic areas shows how the disease has been more correctly interpreted. Here we provide an empirical approach to estimate Annual Parasite Index (API) as well as Equivalent Transmission Index (ETI) using a combination of epidemiological, parasitological and immunological data. We estimate that there were 3 different malariogenic status like low, moderate and high transmission zones based on their' ELISA OD values. Our indigenous developed ETI estimates are 10 fold higher than API reported by the Primary Health Centre. Our record indicates that incidences of malaria will continue to be underestimated unless we adapt an alternative strategy. In order to verify the scope of malaria surveillance, coded samples were tested. Comparison of ELISA OD, API and ETI of the coded samples indicated Rourkela had high, Shahjahanpur had moderate and Bangalore had the lowest malaria transmission. For mass blood slide examination, microscopic method is a tedious process prone to human error while largely automated ELISA could reduce the scope for human error and could be a supplement for microscopic process.},

The composite map resulted in 13 stratification classes. Stratification classes 1-12 fell in non-irrigated tracts and exhibited 95\% matching of areas of high receptivity as revealed by geographical information systems (GIS) and annual malaria parasite incidence (API). Stratification class 13, an irrigated area, showed poor matching but the ground verification established low receptivity of the area. Thus the study resulted in complete reconciliation of cause and effect relationship as established as per GIS in explaining malaria epidemiology.

Indicators were measured for all community hospitals, Vector Borne Disease Control Units, (VBDU), health centers (HC), malaria clinics, and malaria posts in 2003 and 2004 during the first two years of partial integration. The number of Vector Borne Disease Control staff decreased 1.8 - 3\%, and their operational budgets decreased 25\%. The VBDU staff did all the indoor residual spraying (IRS), insecticide treated net (ITN) work and entomology surveys, they took 80.6\% of the blood films, and treated 72\% of the patients, while Public Health system did the remainder. The Annual Parasite Incidence (API) (1 - 10/1,000) and IRS coverage (88 - 100\%) remained adequate in most areas during the first years after partial integration, but the API increased (to 31.6 - 57.6/1,000) in some populations. The percentage of insecticide treated bed net coverage was adequate in Mae Hong Son (95.4\%), but inadequate in Chiang Mai (52.2\%). Early diagnosis and prompt treatment (4 - 23 days), hospitals reporting disruption of anti-malarial drugs (3 of 7), and health centers having all needed equipment, training, and drugs for malaria diagnosis (9\%) remain inadequate. If the program is allowed to diminish, malaria could spread again among the population. Integration of antimalarial activities into the general Public Health system has only been partially successful. We recommend the integration process and results should be monitored and evaluated to find and mitigate problems as they occur, and modify the integration process if needed.},

Here we investigate how changes in malaria control and endemicity modify diagnostic criteria of Plasmodium falciparum attacks.Methods and FindingsParasitological and clinical data from the population of Dielmo, Senegal, monitored during 20 years, are analyzed in a random-effect logistic regression model to investigate the relationship between the level of parasitemia and risk of fever. Between 1990 and 2010, P. falciparum prevalence in asymptomatic persons declined from 85\% to 1\% in children 0–3 years and from 34\% to 2\% in adults ≥50 years. Thresholds levels of parasitemia for attributing fever episodes to malaria decreased by steps in relation to control policies. Using baseline threshold during following periods underestimated P. falciparum attacks by 9.8–20.2\% in children and 18.9–40.2\% in adults. Considering all fever episodes associated with malaria parasites as clinical attacks overestimated P. falciparum attacks by 42.2–68.5\% in children and 45.9–211.7\% in adults.ConclusionsMalaria control modifies in all age-groups the threshold levels of parasitemia to be used for the assessment of malaria morbidity and to guide therapeutic decisions. Even under declining levels of malaria endemicity, the parasite density method must remain the reference method for distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever and assessing trends in the burden of malaria.},

Because bats have been implicated as natural reservoirs for several emerging zoonotic viruses, including SARS-like corona viruses, henipaviruses, and lyssaviruses, understanding how pathogens are maintained within a population becomes vital. Unfortunately, little is known about maintenance mechanisms for any pathogen in bat populations. We present a mathematical model parameterized with unique data from an extensive study of rabies in a Colorado population of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) to elucidate general maintenance mechanisms. We propose that life history patterns of many species of temperate-zone bats, coupled with sufficiently long incubation periods, allows for rabies virus maintenance. Seasonal variability in bat mortality rates, specifically low mortality during hibernation, allows long-term bat population viability. Within viable bat populations, sufficiently long incubation periods allow enough infected individuals to enter hibernation and survive until the following year, and hence avoid an epizootic fadeout of rabies virus. We hypothesize that the slowing effects of hibernation on metabolic and viral activity maintains infected individuals and their pathogens until susceptibles from the annual birth pulse become infected and continue the cycle. This research provides a context to explore similar host ecology and viral dynamics that may explain seasonal patterns and maintenance of other bat-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {Background
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data.
Methods
We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.
Findings
Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1–4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2\% (6·0–8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421–723) to 853 million (642–1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9\% (6·6–9·2) for males and 6·5\% (5·4–7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95\% UI 2782–3252] per 100 000 in males vs s1400 [1279–1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082–3583] vs 2336 [2154–2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943–3630] vs 5643 [5057–6302]).
Interpretation
Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With more than half of Africa's population expected to live in urban settlements by 2030, the burden of malaria among urban populations in Africa continues to rise with an increasing number of people at risk of infection. However, malaria intervention across Africa remains focused on rural, highly endemic communities with far fewer strategic policy directions for the control of malaria in rapidly growing African urban settlements. The complex and heterogeneous nature of urban malaria requires a better understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of urban malaria risk in order to design effective urban malaria control programs. In this study, we use remotely sensed variables and other environmental covariates to examine the predictability of intra-urban variations of malaria infection risk across the rapidly growing city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between 2006 and 2014. METHODS: High resolution SPOT satellite imagery was used to identify urban environmental factors associated malaria prevalence in Dar es Salaam. Supervised classification with a random forest classifier was used to develop high resolution land cover classes that were combined with malaria parasite prevalence data to identify environmental factors that influence localized heterogeneity of malaria transmission and develop a high resolution predictive malaria risk map of Dar es Salaam. RESULTS: Results indicate that the risk of malaria infection varied across the city. The risk of infection increased away from the city centre with lower parasite prevalence predicted in administrative units in the city centre compared to administrative units in the peri-urban suburbs. The variation in malaria risk within Dar es Salaam was shown to be influenced by varying environmental factors. Higher malaria risks were associated with proximity to dense vegetation, inland water and wet/swampy areas while lower risk of infection was predicted in densely built-up areas. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive maps produced can serve as valuable resources for municipal councils aiming to shrink the extents of malaria across cities, target resources for vector control or intensify mosquito and disease surveillance. The semi-automated modelling process developed can be replicated in other urban areas to identify factors that influence heterogeneity in malaria risk patterns and detect vulnerable zones. There is a definite need to expand research into the unique epidemiology of malaria transmission in urban areas for focal elimination and sustained control agendas.},

	abstract = {Malaria has always been an important public health problem in Brazil. The early history of Brazilian malaria and its control was powered by colonisation by Europeans and the forced relocation of Africans as slaves. Internal migration brought malaria to many regions in Brazil where, given suitable Anopheles mosquito vectors, it thrived. Almost from the start, officials recognised the problem malaria presented to economic development, but early control efforts were hampered by still developing public health control and ignorance of the underlying biology and ecology of malaria. Multiple regional and national malaria control efforts have been attempted with varying success. At present, the Amazon Basin accounts for 99\% of Brazil's reported malaria cases with regional increases in incidence often associated with large scale public works or migration. Here, we provide an exhaustive summary of primary literature in English, Spanish and Portuguese regarding Brazilian malaria control. Our goal was not to interpret the history of Brazilian malaria control from a particular political or theoretical perspective, but rather to provide a straightforward, chronological narrative of the events that have transpired in Brazil over the past 200 years and identify common themes.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades efforts to control malaria have halved the number of cases globally, yet burdens remain high in much of Africa and the elimination of malaria has not been achieved even in areas where extreme reductions have been sustained, such as South Africa1,2. Studies seeking to understand the paradoxical persistence of malaria in areas in which surface water is absent for 3–8 months of the year have suggested that some species of Anopheles mosquito use long-distance migration3. Here we confirm this hypothesis through aerial sampling of mosquitoes at 40–290 m above ground level and provide—to our knowledge—the first evidence of windborne migration of African malaria vectors, and consequently of the pathogens that they transmit. Ten species, including the primary malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii, were identified among 235 anopheline mosquitoes that were captured during 617 nocturnal aerial collections in the Sahel of Mali. Notably, females accounted for more than 80\% of all of the mosquitoes that we collected. Of these, 90\% had taken a blood meal before their migration, which implies that pathogens are probably transported over long distances by migrating females. The likelihood of capturing Anopheles species increased with altitude (the height of the sampling panel above ground level) and during the wet seasons, but variation between years and localities was minimal. Simulated trajectories of mosquito flights indicated that there would be mean nightly displacements of up to 300 km for 9-h flight durations. Annually, the estimated numbers of mosquitoes at altitude that cross a 100-km line perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction included 81,000 Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, 6 million A. coluzzii and 44 million Anopheles squamosus. These results provide compelling evidence that millions of malaria vectors that have previously fed on blood frequently migrate over hundreds of kilometres, and thus almost certainly spread malaria over these distances. The successful elimination of malaria may therefore depend on whether the sources of migrant vectors can be identified and controlled.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased control has produced remarkable reductions of malaria in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, including Rwanda. In the southern highlands, near the district capital of Butare (altitude, 1,768 m), a combined community-and facility-based survey on Plasmodium infection was conducted early in 2010. METHODS: A total of 749 children below five years of age were examined including 545 randomly selected from 24 villages, 103 attending the health centre in charge, and 101 at the referral district hospital. Clinical, parasitological, haematological, and socio-economic data were collected. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum infection (mean multiplicity, 2.08) was identified by microscopy and PCR in 11.7\% and 16.7\%, respectively; 5.5\% of the children had malaria. PCR-based P. falciparum prevalence ranged between 0 and 38.5\% in the villages, and was 21.4\% in the health centre, and 14.9\% in the hospital. Independent predictors of infection included increasing age, low mid-upper arm circumference, absence of several household assets, reported recent intake of artemether-lumefantrine, and chloroquine in plasma, measured by ELISA. Self-reported bed net use (58\%) reduced infection only in univariate analysis. In the communities, most infections were seemingly asymptomatic but anaemia was observed in 82\% and 28\% of children with and without parasitaemia, respectively, the effect increasing with parasite density, and significant also for submicroscopic infections. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium falciparum infection in the highlands surrounding Butare, Rwanda, is seen in one out of six children under five years of age. The abundance of seemingly asymptomatic infections in the community forms a reservoir for transmission in this epidemic-prone area. Risk factors suggestive of low socio-economic status and insufficient effectiveness of self-reported bed net use refer to areas of improvable intervention.},

This implies that everybody is all the time at risk of acquiring an infection. These models ignore the fact that the formation of a pair of two susceptibles renders them in a sense temporarily immune to infection as long as the partners do not separate and have no contacts with other partners. The present paper takes into account the phenomenon of pair formation by introducing explicitly a pairing rate and a separation rate. The infection transmission dynamics depends on the contact rate within a pair and the duration of a partnership. It turns out that endemic equilibria can only exist if the separation rate is sufficiently large in order to ensure the necessary number of sexual partners. The classical models are recovered if one lets the separation rate tend to infinity.},

	abstract = {Numerous mathematical models have been developed to gain better insight into the transmission and control of infectious diseases. Yet there are many unsolved problems, partly because the models are still too simple, partly because detailed epidemiologic records are notoriously lacking. The present survey concentrates on virus infections in humans. It is shown that available data do not allow a discrimination between various plausible models for the spread of common cold in households. Similar problems of model identification arise in the analysis of age-specific sero-prevalence-data of antibodies with so-called catalytic models. From such data alone one cannot derive contact rates between different age groups, although knowledge of these rates is needed in order to evaluate the effects of mass immunization and to describe the fluctuating infection incidence patterns. A new deterministic model is presented which takes into account increased infection transmission inside schools. This provides an explanation for one- and two-year periods of recurrent measles epidemics. The paper provides an outlook to future developments in this field.},

Here we investigate the genetics of P. vivax CQR by a cross of parasites differing in drug response. Gametocytogenesis, mosquito infection, and progeny production are performed with mixed parasite populations in nonhuman primates, as methods for P. vivax cloning and in vitro cultivation remain unavailable.

However, until recently, there has been a strong reliance on a limited class of stationary kernels such as the Matérn or squared exponential, limiting the expressiveness of these modelling approaches. Recent machine learning research has focused on spectral representations to model arbitrary stationary kernels and introduced more general representations that include classes of nonstationary kernels. In this paper, we exploit the connections between Fourier feature representations, Gaussian processes and neural networks to generalise previous approaches and develop a simple and efficient framework to learn arbitrarily complex nonstationary kernel functions directly from the data, while taking care to avoid overfitting using state-of-the-art methods from deep learning. We highlight the very broad array of kernel classes that could be created within this framework. We apply this to a time series dataset and a remote sensing problem involving land surface temperature in Eastern Africa. We show that without increasing the computational or storage complexity, nonstationary kernels can be used to improve generalisation performance and provide more interpretable results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Entomological indices within a specific area vary with climatic factors such as rainfall, temperature and relative humidity. Contributions of such weather parameter fluctuations to the changes in entomological data obtained within a community under implementation of a promising vector control intervention should be taken into account. This study reports on inter-annual changes in entomological indices within two rural communities, one of which was under insecticide-treated durable wall lining (DL) installation. METHODS: Community-wide DL installation was followed by monthly meteorological data and pyrethrum spray mosquito collections for 2 years in intervention and a similar neighbouring community (control). Human blood meal and sporozoite ELISA tests were conducted on female mosquitoes collected alongside PCR identification of subsamples. Mosquitoes collected at the intervention site were tested in cone susceptibility assays against subsamples of installed DL materials collected on a 6-monthly basis for 2 years. Deltamethrin susceptibility of Anopheles mosquitoes from the intervention site was determined before and after DL installation. Entomological indices in the first and second years were compared within each site. RESULTS: Rainfall in the study area increased significantly (t = -3.45, df = 11, P = 0.005) from first to second year. Correlation between rainfall and Anopheles densities in both sites were significant (r = 0.681, P {\textless} 0.001). Mosquitoes collected at the intervention site were susceptible (100\%) to deltamethrin at baseline but resistant (92\%) in the second year. However, subsamples of installed DL materials remained effective (100\% mortality) against Anopheles mosquitoes from the intervention site throughout the 6-monthly cone assay exposures. Monthly pyrethrum spray collections showed significant increase in Anopheles densities from first to second year in the control (6.36 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.61 vs 7.83 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2.39; t = -3.47, df = 11, P = 0.005), but not in the intervention (2.83 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.86 vs 4.23 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 3.31; t = -2.03, df = 11, P = 0.067) community. However, mean annual mosquito man-biting rates increased significantly in both intervention (0.88 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.18 vs 1.06 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.38; F(1, 10) = 9.50, P = 0.012) and control (1.45 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.31 vs 1.61 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.34; F(1, 10) = 10.18, p = 0.010) sites along with increase (\${\textbackslash}geq\$ 1.6 times) in sporozoite rates within intervention (0-2.13\%) and control (2.56-4.04\%) communities. CONCLUSIONS: The slight increase in vector density, induced by significant increase in rainfall, led to increased sporozoite infection and significantly increased man-biting rates within the intervention site. These reveal the need for incorporation of integrated vector management strategies to complement DL installation especially in regions with high rainfall and mosquito density. Promising vector control tools such as DL should be evaluated on a long-term basis to reveal the possible effect of weather parameters on control performance and also allow for holistic recommendations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Localized mosquito larval habitat management and the use of larvicides have been proposed as important control tools in integrated malaria vector management programs. In order to optimize the utility of these tools, detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution patterns of mosquito larval habitats is crucial. However, the spatial and temporal changes of habitat distribution patterns under different climatic conditions are rarely quantified and their implications to larval control are unknown. RESULTS: Using larval habitat data collected in western Kenya highlands during both dry and rainy seasons of 2003-2005, this study analyzed the seasonal and inter-annual changes in the spatial patterns in mosquito larval habitat distributions. We found that the spatial patterns of larval habitats had significant temporal variability both seasonally and inter-annually. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of larval habitats is extremely important to the epidemiology of malaria because it results in spatial heterogeneity in the adult mosquito population and, subsequently, the spatial distribution of clinical malaria cases. Results from this study suggest that larval habitat management activities need to consider the dynamic nature of malaria vector habitats.},

	abstract = {Climate drives population dynamics, but when the underlying mechanisms are unresolved, studies can lead to seemingly context-dependent effects of climate on natural populations. For climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, climate appears to have opposing effects in different contexts. In this study, our objective was to test the extent to which a mathematical model, parameterized with climate-driven mosquito physiology measured in laboratory studies, predicts observed vector and disease dynamics in the field across ecologically and culturally distinct settings in Ecuador and Kenya. The model incorporates different rainfall functions and time lags. We show that the climate-driven model captures three key epidemic characteristics across settings: the number, timing, and duration of outbreaks. In addition, the model generates a range of disease dynamics consistent with observations of Aedes aegypti abundances and laboratory-confirmed arboviral incidence with varying levels of accuracy (28 – 85\% for vector dynamics, 44 – 88\% for human disease dynamics). Further, we find that the model predicted vector dynamics better in sites with a smaller proportion of young children in the population, lower mean temperature, and a larger proportion of homes with piped water and made of cement. A mechanistic model with limited calibration to local data that robustly captures the influence of climate on viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti provides critical information to help guide future intervention efforts and improve disease projections associated with climate change. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

On an interannual scale, periods of above normal rainfall in East Africa are associated with the warm phase of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Anomalous rainfall floods mosquito-breeding habitats called dambos, which contain transovarially infected mosquito eggs. The eggs hatch Aedes mosquitoes that transmit the RVF virus preferentially to livestock and to humans as well. Analysis of historical data on RVF outbreaks and indicators of ENSO (including Pacific and Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and the Southern Oscillation Index) indicates that more than three quarters of the RVF outbreaks have occurred during warm ENSO event periods. Mapping of ecological conditions using satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data show that areas where outbreaks have occurred during the satellite recording period (1981-1998) show anomalous positive departures in vegetation greenness, an indicator of above-normal precipitation. This is particularly observed in arid areas of East Africa, which are predominantly impacted by this disease. These results indicate a close association between interannual climate variability and RVF outbreaks in Kenya.},

It is one of the fastest-growing global infectious diseases, with 100-400 million new infections a year, and is now entrenched in a growing number of tropical megacities. Behind this rapid rise is the simple adaptation of Ae. aegypti to a new entomological niche carved out by human habitation. This review describes the expansion of dengue and explores how key changes in the ecology of Ae. aegypti allowed it to become a successful invasive species and highly efficient disease vector. We argue that characterizing geographic heterogeneity in mosquito bionomics will be a key research priority that will enable us to better understand future dengue risk and design control strategies to reverse its global spread.

After 2 years without paralytic cases in a population of 200,000 inhabitants, the probability for the presence of silent infections can still be as high as 38\%. The case-free period must exceed 3 years before one can be 95\% certain that there has been local extinction of the wild polio virus infection.

We show for the first time that for such models we can give an expression for the minimum effort required to eradicate the infection if we concentrate on control measures affecting the transmission rate constant beta. This eradication effort is explicitly expressed in terms of alpha,r, and mu As in models without backward bifurcation it can be interpreted as a reproduction number, but not necessarily as the basic reproduction number. We define the relevant reproduction numbers for this purpose. The eradication effort can be estimated from the endemic steady state. The classical basic reproduction number R0 is smaller than the eradication effort for r {\textgreater} 1 + (mu/alpha) and equal to the effort for other values of r.

Using statistical mapping techniques, we show that human movement patterns explain the spread of both species in Europe and the United States following their introduction. We find that the spread of Ae. aegypti is characterized by long distance importations, while Ae. albopictus has expanded more along the fringes of its distribution. We describe these processes and predict the future distributions of both species in response to accelerating urbanization, connectivity and climate change. Global surveillance and control efforts that aim to mitigate the spread of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses must consider the so far unabated spread of these mosquitos.

The impressive depth of available time-series from such missions (e.g., MODIS and AVHRR) affords new opportunities for improving data usability by leveraging spatial and temporal information inherent to longitudinal geospatial datasets. In this research we develop an approach for filling gaps in imagery time-series that result primarily from cloud cover, which is particularly problematic in forested equatorial regions. Our approach consists of two, complementary gap-filling algorithms and a variety of run-time options that allow users to balance competing demands of model accuracy and processing time. We applied the gap-filling methodology to MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and daytime and nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets for the African continent for 2000-2012, with a 1 km spatial resolution, and an 8-day temporal resolution. We validated the method by introducing and filling artificial gaps, and then comparing the original data with model predictions. Our approach achieved R2 values above 0.87 even for pixels within 500 km wide introduced gaps. Furthermore, the structure of our approach allows estimation of the error associated with each gap-filled pixel based on the distance to the non-gap pixels used to model its fill value, thus providing a mechanism for including uncertainty associated with the gap-filling process in downstream applications of the resulting datasets.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mosquito biting rates and host preferences are crucial determinants of human exposure to vector-borne diseases and the impact of vector control measures. The human landing catch (HLC) is a gold standard method for measuring human exposure to bites, but presents risks to participants by requiring some exposure to mosquito vectors. Mosquito electrocuting traps (METs) represent an exposure-free alternative to HLCs for measuring human exposure to malaria vectors. However, original MET prototypes were too small for measuring whole-body biting rates on humans or large animals like cattle. Here a much larger MET capable of encompassing humans or cattle was designed, and its performance was evaluated relative to both the original small MET and HLC and for quantifying malaria vector host preferences. METHODS: Human landing catch, small human-baited METs (MET-SH), and large METs baited with either a human (MET-LH) or calves (MET-LC) were simultaneously used to capture wild malaria vectors outdoors in rural southern Tanzania. The four capture methods were compared in a Latin-square design over 20 nights. Malaria vector host preferences were estimated through comparison of the number of mosquitoes caught by large METs baited with either humans or cattle. RESULTS: The MET-LH caught more than twice as many Anopheles arabiensis than either the MET-SH or HLC. It also caught higher number of Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.) compared to the MET-SH or HLC. Similar numbers of An. funestus sensu stricto (s.s.) were caught in MET-LH and MET-SH collections. Catches of An. arabiensis with human or cattle-baited large METs were similar, indicating no clear preference for either host. In contrast, An. funestus s.s. exhibited a strong, but incomplete preference for humans. CONCLUSIONS: METs are a sensitive, practical tool for assessing mosquito biting rates and host preferences, and represent a safer alternative to the HLC. Additionally these findings suggest the HLC underestimate whole-body human exposure. MET collections indicated the An. funestus s.s. population in this setting had a higher than expected attack rate on cattle, potentially making eliminating of this species more difficult with human-targetted control measures. Supplementary vector control tools targetted at livestock may be required to effectively tackle this species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Portfolio effects were first described as a basis for mitigating against financial risk by diversifying investments. Distributing investment across several different assets can stabilize returns and reduce risks by statistical averaging of individual asset dynamics that often correlate weakly or negatively with each other. The same simple probability theory is equally applicable to complex ecosystems, in which biological and environmental diversity stabilizes ecosystems against natural and human-mediated perturbations. Given the fundamental limitations to how well the full complexity of ecosystem dynamics can be understood or anticipated, the portfolio effect concept provides a simple framework for more critical data interpretation and pro-active conservation management. Applied to conservation ecology purposes, the portfolio effect concept informs management strategies emphasizing identification and maintenance of key ecological processes that generate complexity, diversity and resilience against inevitable, often unpredictable perturbations. IMPLICATIONS: Applied to the reciprocal goal of eliminating the least valued elements of global biodiversity, specifically lethal malaria parasites and their vector mosquitoes, simply understanding the portfolio effect concept informs more cautious interpretation of surveillance data and simulation model predictions. Malaria transmission mediated by guilds of multiple vectors in complex landscapes, with highly variable climatic and meteorological conditions, as well as changing patterns of land use and other human behaviours, will systematically tend to be more resilient to attack with vector control than it appears based on even the highest quality surveillance data or predictive models. CONCLUSION: Malaria vector control programmes may need to be more ambitious, interpret their short-to-medium term assessments of intervention impact more cautiously, and manage stakeholder expectations more conservatively than has often been the case thus far.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes that feed on animals can survive and mediate residual transmission of malaria even after most humans have been protected with insecticidal bednets or indoor residual sprays. Ivermectin is a widely-used drug for treating parasites of humans and animals that is also insecticidal, killing mosquitoes that feed on treated subjects. Mass administration of ivermectin to livestock could be particularly useful for tackling residual malaria transmission by zoophagic vectors that evade human-centred approaches. Ivermectin comes from a different chemical class to active ingredients currently used to treat bednets or spray houses, so it also has potential for mitigating against emergence of insecticide resistance. However, the duration of insecticidal activity obtained with ivermectin is critical to its effectiveness and affordability. RESULTS: A slow-release formulation for ivermectin was implanted into cattle, causing 40 weeks of increased mortality among Anopheles arabiensis that fed on them. For this zoophagic vector of residual malaria transmission across much of Africa, the proportion surviving three days after feeding (typical mean duration of a gonotrophic cycle in field populations) was approximately halved for 25 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This implantable ivermectin formulation delivers stable and sustained insecticidal activity for approximately 6 months. Residual malaria transmission by zoophagic vectors could be suppressed by targeting livestock with this long-lasting formulation, which would be impractical or unacceptable for mass treatment of human populations.},

Here, large replicated mesocosms were used to measure the population-level response of the malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis to long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) when used in isolation, or combined with insecticidal eave louvers (EL), or treatment of cattle with the endectocide Ivermectin (IM). State-space models (SSM) were fit to these experimental data, revealing that LLIN introduction reduced adult mosquito survival by 91\% but allowed population persistence. ELs provided no additional benefit, but IM reduced mosquito fecundity by 59\% and nearly eliminated all populations when combined with LLINs. This highlights the value of IM for integrated vector control, and mesocosm population experiments combined with SSM for identifying optimal combinations for vector population elimination.},

Using existing entomological and epidemiological survey data, here we illustrate how topography can also be used to map out the interfaces between wet, unoccupied valleys and dry, densely populated uplands, where malaria vector densities and infection risk are focally exacerbated. These topographically identifiable geophysical boundaries experience disproportionately high vector densities and malaria transmission risk, because this is where Anopheles mosquitoes first encounter humans when they search for blood after emerging or ovipositing in the valleys. Geophysical topographic indicators accounted for 67\% of variance for vector density but for only 43\% for infection prevalence, so they could enable very selective targeting of interventions against the former but not the latter (targeting ratios of 5.7 versus 1.5 to 1, respectively). So, in addition to being useful for targeting larval source management to wet valleys, geophysical topographic indicators may also be used to selectively target adult Anopheles mosquitoes with insecticidal residual sprays, fencing, vapour emanators or space sprays to barrier areas along their fringes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Additional vector control tools (VCTs) are needed to supplement insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) to achieve malaria elimination in many settings. To identify options for expanding the malaria vector control toolbox, we conducted a systematic review of the availability and quality of the evidence for 21 malaria VCTs, excluding ITNs and IRS. METHODS: Six electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched from January 1, 1980 to September 28, 2015 to identify systematic reviews, Phase I-IV studies, and observational studies that measured the effect of malaria VCTs on epidemiological or entomological outcomes across any age groups in all malaria-endemic settings. Eligible studies were summarized qualitatively, with quality and risk of bias assessments undertaken where possible. Of 17,912 studies screened, 155 were eligible for inclusion and were included in a qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: Across the 21 VCTs, we found considerable heterogeneity in the volume and quality of evidence, with 7 VCTs currently supported by at least one Phase III community-level evaluation measuring parasitologically confirmed malaria incidence or infection prevalence (insecticide-treated clothing and blankets, insecticide-treated hammocks, insecticide-treated livestock, larval source management (LSM), mosquito-proofed housing, spatial repellents, and topical repellents). The remaining VCTs were supported by one or more Phase II (n=13) or Phase I evaluation (n=1). Overall the quality of the evidence base remains greatest for LSM and topical repellents, relative to the other VCTs evaluated, although existing evidence indicates that topical repellents are unlikely to provide effective population-level protection against malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial gaps in the supporting evidence, several VCTs may be promising supplements to ITNs and IRS in appropriate settings. Strengthening operational capacity and research to implement underutilized VCTs, such as LSM and mosquito-proofed housing, using an adaptive, learning-by-doing approach, while expanding the evidence base for promising supplementary VCTs that are locally tailored, should be considered central to global malaria elimination efforts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The vapor phase of the volatile pyrethroid transfluthrin incapacitates mosquitoes and prevents them from feeding. Although existing emanator products for delivering volatile pyrethroids protect against outdoor mosquito bites, they are too short-lived to be practical or affordable for routine use in low-income settings. New transfluthrin emanators, comprised simply of treated hessian fabric strips, have recently proven highly protective against outdoor-biting vectors of lymphatic filariasis, arboviruses and malaria, but their full protective lifespan, minimum dose requirements, and range of protection have not previously been assessed. METHODOLOGY: The effects of transfluthrin-treated hessian strips upon mosquito biting exposure of users and nearby non-users, as well as dependence of protection upon treatment dose, were measured outdoors in rural Tanzania using human landing catches (HLC). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Strips treated with 10ml of transfluthrin prevented at least three quarters (p 90\% protection against bites on warmer nights with higher evaporation rates, for at least one year. Strips treated with this high dose also reduced biting exposure of non-users at a distance of up to 5m from the strips for An. arabiensis (p {\textless} 0.001) and up to 2m for Mansonia spp. (p = 0.008), but provided no protection to non-users against Culex spp. No evidence of increased risk for non-users, caused by diversion of mosquitoes to unprotected individuals, was found at any distance within an 80m radius. A dose of only 1ml provided equivalent protection to the 10ml dose against An. arabiensis, Culex spp. and Mansonia spp. mosquitoes over 6 months (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Transfluthrin-treated hessian emanators provide safe, affordable, long-term protection against several different pathogen-transmitting mosquito taxa that attack humans outdoors, where they are usually active and cannot be protected by bed nets or residual sprays with conventional, solid-phase insecticides.},

	abstract = {Vector control using long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) accounts for most of the malaria burden reductions achieved recently in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). LLINs and IRS are highly effective, but are insufficient to eliminate malaria transmission in many settings because of operational constraints, growing resistance to available insecticides and mosquitoes that behaviourally avoid contact with these interventions. However, a number of substantive opportunities now exist for rapidly developing and implementing more diverse, effective and sustainable malaria vector control strategies for LMICs. For example, mosquito control in high-income countries is predominantly achieved with a combination of mosquito-proofed housing and environmental management, supplemented with large-scale insecticide applications to larval habitats and outdoor spaces that kill off vector populations en masse, but all these interventions remain underused in LMICs. Programmatic development and evaluation of decentralised, locally managed systems for delivering these proactive mosquito population abatement practices in LMICs could therefore enable broader scale-up. Furthermore, a diverse range of emerging or repurposed technologies are becoming available for targeting mosquitoes when they enter houses, feed outdoors, attack livestock, feed on sugar or aggregate into mating swarms. Global policy must now be realigned to mobilise the political and financial support necessary to exploit these opportunities over the decade ahead, so that national malaria control and elimination programmes can access a much broader, more effective set of vector control interventions.},

	abstract = {Residual malaria transmission can persist despite high coverage with effective long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and/or indoor residual spraying (IRS), because many vector mosquitoes evade them by feeding on animals, feeding outdoors, resting outdoors or rapidly exiting from houses after entering them. However, many of these behaviours that render vectors resilient to control with IRS and LLINs also make them vulnerable to some emerging new alternative interventions. Furthermore, vector control measures targeting preferred behaviours of mosquitoes often force them to express previously rare alternative behaviours, which can then be targeted with these complementary new interventions. For example, deployment of LLINs against vectors that historically fed predominantly indoors on humans typically results in persisting transmission by residual populations that survive by feeding outdoors on humans and animals, where they may then be targeted with vapour-phase insecticides and veterinary insecticides, respectively. So while the ability of mosquitoes to express alternative behaviours limits the impact of LLINs and IRS, it also creates measurable and unprecedented opportunities for deploying complementary additional approaches that would otherwise be ineffective. Now that more diverse vector control methods are finally becoming available, well-established entomological field techniques for surveying adult mosquito behaviours should be fully exploited by national malaria control programmes, to rationally and adaptively map out new opportunities for their effective deployment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As areas move closer to malaria elimination, a combination of limited resources and increasing heterogeneity in case distribution and transmission favour a shift to targeted reactive interventions. Reactive case detection (RCD), the following up of additional individuals surrounding an index case, has the potential to target transmission pockets and identify asymptomatic cases in them. Current RCD implementation strategies vary, and it is unclear which are most effective in achieving elimination. METHODS: OpenMalaria, an established individual-based stochastic model, was used to simulate RCD in a Zambia-like setting. The capacity to follow up index cases, the search radius, the initial transmission and the case management coverage were varied. Suitable settings were identified and probabilities of elimination and time to elimination estimated. The value of routinely collected prevalence and incidence data for predicting the success of RCD was assessed. RESULTS: The results indicate that RCD with the aim of transmission interruption is only appropriate in settings where initial transmission is very low (annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) 1-2 or prevalence approx. {\textless} 7-19\% depending on case management levels). Every index case needs to be followed up, up to a maximum case-incidence threshold which defines the suitability threshold of settings for elimination using RCD. Increasing the search radius around index cases is always beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: RCD is highly resource intensive, requiring testing and treating of 400-500 people every week for 5-10 years for a reasonable chance of elimination in a Zambia-like setting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reactive case detection (RCD) is an integral part of many malaria control and elimination programmes and can be conceived of as a way of gradually decreasing transmission. However, it is unclear under what circumstances RCD may have a substantial impact on prevalence, how likely it is to lead to local elimination, or how effective it needs to be to prevent reintroduction after transmission has been interrupted. METHODS: Analyses and simulations of a discrete time compartmental susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model were used to understand the mechanisms of how RCD changes transmission dynamics and estimate the impact of RCD programmes in a range of settings with varying patterns of transmission potential and programme characteristics. Prevalence survey data from recent studies in Zambia were used to capture the effects of spatial clustering of patent infections. RESULTS: RCD proved most effective at low prevalence. Increasing the number of index cases followed was more important than increasing the number of neighbours tested per index case. Elimination was achieved only in simulations of situations with very low transmission intensity and following many index cases. However, RCD appears to be helpful in maintaining the disease-free state after achieving malaria elimination (through other interventions). CONCLUSION: RCD alone can eliminate malaria in only a very limited range of settings, where transmission potential is very low, and improving the coverage of RCD has little effect on this range. In other settings, it is likely to reduce disease burden. RCD may also help maintain the disease-free state in the face of imported infections. Prevalence survey data can be used to estimate a targeting ratio (the ratio of prevalence found through RCD to that in the general population) which is an important determinant of the effect of RCD.},

Since resources are limited, prioritisation of countries or areas for elimination is often necessary. However, this prioritisation is frequently conducted in an ad hoc manner. Lower transmission areas are usually targeted for elimination first, but for some areas this necessitates long and potentially expensive surveillance programs while transmission is eliminated from neighbouring higher transmission areas. We use a mathematical model to compare the implications of prioritisation choices in reducing overall burden and costs. We show that when the duration of the elimination program is independent of the transmission potential, burden is always reduced most by targeting high transmission areas first, but to reduce costs the optimal ordering depends on the actual transmission levels. In general, when overall transmission potential is low and the surveillance cost per secondary case compared to the cost per imported case is low, targeting the higher transmission area for elimination first is favoured.},

We look at the potential of the interventions to eliminate transmission within 20 years.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current strategies to control mosquito-transmitted infections use insecticides targeted at various stages of the mosquito life-cycle. Control is increasingly compromised by the evolution of insecticide resistance but there is little quantitative understanding of its impact on control effectiveness. We developed a computational approach that incorporates the stage-structured mosquito life-cycle and allows tracking of insecticide resistant genotypes. This approach makes it possible to simultaneously investigate: (i) the population dynamics of mosquitoes throughout their whole life-cycle; (ii) the impact of common vector control interventions on disease transmission; (iii) how these interventions drive the spread of insecticide resistance; and (iv) the impact of resistance once it has arisen and, in particular, whether it is sufficient for malaria transmission to resume. The model consists of a system of difference equations that tracks the immature (eggs, larvae and pupae) and adult stages, for males and females separately, and incorporates density-dependent regulation of mosquito larvae in breeding sites. RESULTS: We determined a threshold level of mosquitoes below which transmission of malaria is interrupted. It is based on a classic Ross-Macdonald derivation of the malaria basic reproductive number (R0) and may be used to assess the effectiveness of different control strategies in terms of whether they are likely to interrupt disease transmission. We simulated different scenarios of insecticide deployment by changing key parameters in the model to explore the comparative impact of insecticide treated nets, indoor residual spraying and larvicides. CONCLUSIONS: Our simulated results suggest that relatively low degrees of resistance (in terms of reduced mortality following insecticide contact) can induce failure of interventions, and the rate of spread of resistance is faster when insecticides target the larval stages. The optimal disease control strategy depends on vector species demography and local environmental conditions but, in our illustrative parametrisation, targeting larval stages achieved the greatest reduction of the adult population, followed by targeting of non-host-seeking females, as provided by indoor residual spraying. Our approach is designed to be flexible and easily generalizable to many scenarios using different calibrations and to diseases other than malaria.},

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effect of climate change on malaria transmission in West Africa. METHODS: We coupled a detailed mechanistic hydrology and entomology model with climate projections from general circulation models (GCMs) to predict changes in vectorial capacity, an indication of the risk of human malaria infections, resulting from changes in the availability of mosquito breeding sites and temperature-dependent development rates. Because there is strong disagreement in climate predictions from different GCMs, we focused on the GCM projections that produced the best and worst conditions for malaria transmission in each zone of the study area. RESULTS: Simulation-based estimates suggest that in the desert fringes of the Sahara, vectorial capacity would increase under the worst-case scenario, but not enough to sustain transmission. In the transitional zone of the Sahel, climate change is predicted to decrease vectorial capacity. In the wetter regions to the south, our estimates suggest an increase in vectorial capacity under all scenarios. However, because malaria is already highly endemic among human populations in these regions, we expect that changes in malaria incidence would be small. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of rainfall in shaping the impact of climate change on malaria transmission in future climates. Even under the GCM predictions most conducive to malaria transmission, we do not expect to see a significant increase in malaria prevalence in this region.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: An ongoing Zika virus pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean has raised concerns that travel-related introduction of Zika virus could initiate local transmission in the United States (U.S.) by its primary vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti. METHODS: We employed meteorologically driven models for 2006-2015 to simulate the potential seasonal abundance of adult Aedes aegypti for fifty cities within or near the margins of its known U.S. range. Mosquito abundance results were analyzed alongside travel and socioeconomic factors that are proxies of viral introduction and vulnerability to human-vector contact. RESULTS: Meteorological conditions are largely unsuitable for Aedes aegypti over the U.S. during winter months (December-March), except in southern Florida and south Texas where comparatively warm conditions can sustain low-to-moderate potential mosquito abundance. Meteorological conditions are suitable for Aedes aegypti across all fifty cities during peak summer months (July-September), though the mosquito has not been documented in all cities. Simulations indicate the highest mosquito abundance occurs in the Southeast and south Texas where locally acquired cases of Aedes-transmitted viruses have been reported previously. Cities in southern Florida and south Texas are at the nexus of high seasonal suitability for Aedes aegypti and strong potential for travel-related virus introduction. Higher poverty rates in cities along the U.S.-Mexico border may correlate with factors that increase human exposure to Aedes aegypti. DISCUSSION: Our results can inform baseline risk for local Zika virus transmission in the U.S. and the optimal timing of vector control activities, and underscore the need for enhanced surveillance for Aedes mosquitoes and Aedes-transmitted viruses.},

Each case had 0.164 (95\% CI: 0, 1.31) sufficiently close contacts on average during the fever period that preceded the rash and 6.87 (95\% CI: 4.52, 10.1) sufficiently close contacts during the whole course of infectivity. These results support the widely held belief that smallpox spreads slowly, mainly among close contacts, and that infectivity before the onset of rash was negligible.},

The paper starts with a survey of previous work in this area. We suppose that we are given data in the form of an age-related serological profile with a given vaccination program. This is used to estimate the reproductive ratio and evaluate vaccination campaigns. The effect of different mixing patterns, such as homogeneous mixing, assortative mixing, proportional mixing, and symmetric mixing are discussed. R phi denotes the reproductive ratio when a steady-state vaccination campaign phi is used. Assortative mixing maximizes the reproductive ratio R phi. A mixing pattern which minimizes R phi and a lower bound for R phi for the important symmetric mixing case are found. The most usual situation is that we are given the age-serological profile with no vaccination so that we have bounds for the basic reproductive ratio R0. These results are illustrated with an application to vaccination against hepatitis A in Bulgaria. Numerical evaluations of the effect of different elimination vaccination strategies are examined.},

For each of these processes, we show typical patterns in the age–intensity profile and provide, if possible, explicit and simple solutions for the age-dependent mean parasite burden and the corresponding dispersion patterns. Emphasis is given to density-dependent parasite establishment and to age–intensity profiles resulting from the superposition of different processes. By means of 2 examples we show that the interpretation of observed patterns can be ambiguous if more than 1 process takes place. These findings underline that age–intensity profiles should be interpreted on the basis of available a priori knowledge about the processes assumed to be involved.

It is assumed that the infection of any member of a household results in the infection of all susceptible members of that household. The threshold parameters have simple expressions in terms of the mean household size and the mean and variance of the number of susceptibles per household. They provide a basic reproduction number R0 for the spread of infection from individual to individual and a basic reproduction number RH0 for the spread of infection from household to household. The threshold parameters are used to derive the levels of immunity required for the prevention of major epidemics in the community. They are also used to evaluate various vaccination strategies having the same vaccination coverage. For a community with households of equal size, it is found that random vaccination of individuals is better than immunizing all members of a corresponding fraction of households. In contrast, when households have varying sizes, immunizing all members of large households can be better than a corresponding vaccination coverage of randomly selected individuals. It is illustrated that these threshold parameters can also be used for a community of households with schools or day care centers. In particular, the effectiveness of immunizing all members of a school is quantified.},

Climate is a major limiting factor in the spatial and temporal distribution of malaria, but many non-climatic factors may alter or override the effect of climate. Thirty years of monthly malaria incidence data from KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, reveal strong medium and long-term trends, which were not present in the climate data. This paper explores various non-climatic factors that may have contributed towards the observed trends. The development of antimalarial drug resistance, available information on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, cross-border people movements, agricultural activities, emergence of insecticide resistance and the case reporting system are reviewed and their potential effect on malaria transmission examined. Single-variable linear regression analysis showed significant association between seasonal case totals (log-transformed) and the measured level of drug resistance (log-transformed) (r2=0.558, n=10, P=0.013) as well as relative measures of HIV infection since 1990 (r2=0.846, n=11, P=0.001). The other factors appear to have affected the level of malaria transmission at certain periods and to some degree. The importance of surveillance and inclusion of non-climatic variables in analysis of malaria data is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Africa's maternal mortality rate (625 deaths/100,000 live births) is high for a middle-income country, although over 90\% of pregnant women utilize maternal health services. Alongside HIV/AIDS, barriers to Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care currently impede the country's Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) of reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. While health system barriers to obstetric care have been well documented, “patient-oriented” barriers have been neglected. This article explores affordability, availability and acceptability barriers to obstetric care in South Africa from the perspectives of women who had recently used, or attempted to use, these services. METHODS: A mixed-method study design combined 1,231 quantitative exit interviews with sixteen qualitative in-depth interviews with women (over 18) in two urban and two rural health sub-districts in South Africa. Between June 2008 and September 2009, information was collected on use of, and access to, obstetric services, and socioeconomic and demographic details. Regression analysis was used to test associations between descriptors of the affordability, availability and acceptability of services, and demographic and socioeconomic predictor variables. Qualitative interviews were coded deductively and inductively using ATLAS ti.6. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated into an analysis of access to obstetric services and related barriers. RESULTS: Access to obstetric services was impeded by affordability, availability and acceptability barriers. These were unequally distributed, with differences between socioeconomic groups and geographic areas being most important. Rural women faced the greatest barriers, including longest travel times, highest costs associated with delivery, and lowest levels of service acceptability, relative to urban residents. Negative provider-patient interactions, including staff inattentiveness, turning away women in early-labour, shouting at patients, and insensitivity towards those who had experienced stillbirths, also inhibited access and compromised quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: To move towards achieving its MDGs, South Africa cannot just focus on increasing levels of obstetric coverage, but must systematically address the access constraints facing women during pregnancy and delivery. More needs to be done to respond to these “patient-oriented” barriers by improving how and where services are provided, particularly in rural areas and for poor women, as well as altering the attitudes and actions of health care providers.},

We understand affordability as the 'degree of fit' between the costs of seeking health care and a household's ability-to-pay. Exit interviews were conducted with over 300 patients for each of the three tracer conditions in each of the four sites (i.e. a total sample of over 3600). Total direct costs for the service used at the time of the interview, as well as other health related costs incurred during the preceding month either for self-care or the use of plural providers were assessed, as were a range of indicators of ability-to-pay. The percentage of households incurring direct costs exceeding 10\% of household consumption expenditure and those borrowing money or selling assets as a mechanism for coping with the burden of direct costs were calculated. Logistic regressions were also conducted to identify factors that were significantly associated with these indicators of affordability. There were significant differences in affordability between rural and urban sites; costs were higher, ability-to-pay was lower and there was a greater proportion of households selling assets or borrowing money in rural areas. There were also significant differences across tracers, with a higher percentage of households receiving tuberculosis and antiretroviral treatment borrowing money or selling assets than those using obstetric services. As these conditions require expenses to be incurred on an ongoing basis, the sustainability of such coping strategies is questionable. Policy makers need to explore how to reduce direct costs for users of these key health services in the context of the particular characteristics of different treatment types. Affordability needs to be considered in relation to the dynamic aspects of the costs of treating different conditions and the timing of treatment in relation to diagnosis. The frequently high transport costs associated with treatments involving multiple consultations can be addressed by initiatives that provide close-to-client services and subsidised patient transport for referrals.},

The implication of these findings is that simple production models should often be used in stock assessments based on catch/effort data, even when more realistic and structurally correct models are available to the analyst; the best choice depends on how much contrast has occurred in the historical effort and catch per unit effort data, rather than on prior knowledge about which model structure is biologically more realistic.},

We used Bayesian geostatistical modelling to estimate LRI incidence, prevalence and mortality in children under 5 subnationally in Africa for 2000-2017, using surveys covering 1.46 million children and 9,215,000 cases of LRI. Our model reveals large within-country variation in both health burden and its change over time. While reductions in childhood morbidity and mortality due to LRI were estimated for almost every country, we expose a cluster of residual high risk across seven countries, which averages 5.5 LRI deaths per 1,000 children per year.

	abstract = {Effective vector control, and more specifically mosquito control, is a complex and difficult problem, as illustrated by the continuing prevalence (and spread) of mosquito-transmitted diseases. The sterile insect technique and similar methods control certain agricultural insect pest populations in a species-specific, environmentally sound, and effective manner; there is increased interest in applying this approach to vector control. Such an approach, like all others in use and development, is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and will be more appropriate in some situations than others. In addition, the proposed release of pest insects, and more so genetically modified pest insects, is bound to raise questions in the general public and the scientific community as to such a method's efficacy, safety, and sustainability. This article attempts to address these concerns and indicate where sterile-insect methods are likely to be useful for vector control.},

Aedes aegypti is the major vector of dengue viruses in its range and control of this mosquito would reduce significantly human morbidity and mortality. Present mosquito control methods are not sufficiently effective and new approaches are needed urgently. A “sterile-male-release” strategy based on the release of mosquitoes carrying a conditional dominant lethal gene is an attractive new control methodology. Transgenic strains of Aedes aegypti were engineered to have a repressible female-specific flightless phenotype using either two separate transgenes or a single transgene, based on the use of a female-specific indirect flight muscle promoter from the Aedes aegypti Actin-4 gene. These strains eliminate the need for sterilization by irradiation, permit male-only release (“genetic sexing”), and enable the release of eggs instead of adults. Furthermore, these strains are expected to facilitate area-wide control or elimination of dengue if adopted as part of an integrated pest management strategy.},

The most effective mosquito control methods include a variety of insecticidal tools that target adults or juveniles. Their successful implementation depends on impacting the largest proportion of the vector population possible. We demonstrate a control strategy that dramatically improves the efficiency with which high coverage of aquatic mosquito habitats can be achieved. The method exploits adult mosquitoes as vehicles of insecticide transfer by harnessing their fundamental behaviors to disseminate a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA) between resting and oviposition sites. A series of field trials undertaken in an Amazon city (Iquitos, Peru) showed that the placement of JHA dissemination stations in just 3-5\% of the available resting area resulted in almost complete coverage of sentinel aquatic habitats. More than control mortality occurred in 95-100\% of the larval cohorts of Aedes aegypti developing at those sites. Overall reductions in adult emergence of 42-98\% were achieved during the trials. A deterministic simulation model predicts amplifications in coverage consistent with our observations and highlights the importance of the residual activity of the insecticide for this technique.},

In the same year, Ronald Ross initiated the first antilarval measures for malaria control. This paper reviews 100 years of malaria field research and control in Sierra Leone, which became known as the ?White Man's Grave? in the 19th century largely because of the high malaria-related mortality amongst Europeans living there. The establishment of a field laboratory for the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Freetown in 1920 made Sierra Leone the centre for malaria field research in Africa up to and during the Second World War. Eminent malariologists including Ronald Ross, Samuel Christophers, George Macdonald, Leonard Bruce-Chwatt, Brian Maegraith, Ian Macgregor, Brian Greenwood and Michael Service visited Sierra Leone for malaria-related activities. This review highlights the tremendous efforts made towards defining the epidemiological picture of the disease and the most effective means of combatting it. Malaria control in Sierra Leone, as in many other parts of the world, used to be based largely on mosquito eradication. However, experience gained over the past 100 years has shown that mosquito control is often not cost-effective in areas where the interruption of transmission cannot be sustained. Emphasis should now be on early diagnosis, treatment with effective antimalarials, and the selective use of preventive measures including vector control and insecticide-treated materials where they can be sustained.},

Surface wetness was positively associated with the subsequent abundance of the dominant floodwater mosquito species, Aedes vexans, and the swamp water species, Anopheles walkeri. The subsequent abundance of Culex pipiens, a species that breeds in polluted, eutrophic waters, was negatively correlated with local modeled surface wetness. These associations permit real-time monitoring and forecasting of these floodwater and nonfloodwater species at high spatial and temporal resolution.

If flight is suppressed this may lead to reductions in blood-feeding and oviposition and thus a reduction in their reproductive capacity. Although wind usually inhibits flight it appears that newly emerged adults of some mosquito species are specially adapted to take-off and flight in windy weather, thus promoting dispersal and colonization of new areas. Dispersal of simuliids and mosquitoes can be very important in control programmes as they can create problems of recolonization. Because air turbulence and convection are usually greatest during the day, simuliids and day-flying mosquitoes are more likely to be swept into the upper air and carried long distances than mosquito species that are active at night.},

The vector's house leaving behaviour was evaluated with exit traps and it was noted that early exophily (i.e., deliberate) was not detected in any of the vectors. Assortative indoor/outdoor resting behaviour was studied by a capture-mark-release-recapture method and showed that in An. arabiensis both indoor and outdoor resting traits were present in the same individuals. Samples of half-gravid female An. gambiae s.l. were chromosomally identified either as Anopheles gambiae s.s. or An. arabiensis and in a subsample chromosomal inversions were read. Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis had the 2Rb inversion but in addition the 2La inversion was found in An. gambiae s.s. and this is an indication of low chromosomal variation. At Ahero An. arabiensis was most abundant when the rice crop was immature and An. funestus when the crop was mature. This succession of vectors facilitated the transmission of malaria throughout the year. At Miwani, An. gambiae s.l. population peaked during the long rains but the proportion of An. arabiensis was highest during the dry season. The indoor resting density of males of the three vector species was less than half of the females.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent global progress in scaling up malaria control interventions has revived the goal of complete elimination in many countries. Decreasing transmission intensity generally leads to increasingly patchy spatial patterns of malaria transmission in elimination settings, with control programs having to accurately identify remaining foci in order to efficiently target interventions. FINDINGS: The role of connectivity between different pockets of local transmission is of increasing importance as programs near elimination since humans are able to transfer parasites beyond the limits of mosquito dispersal, thus re-introducing parasites to previously malaria-free regions. Here, we discuss recent advances in the quantification of spatial epidemiology of malaria, particularly Plasmodium falciparum, in the context of transmission reduction interventions. Further, we highlight the challenges and promising directions for the development of integrated mapping, modeling, and genomic approaches that leverage disparate datasets to measure both connectivity and transmission. CONCLUSION: A more comprehensive understanding of the spatial transmission of malaria can be gained using a combination of parasite genetics and epidemiological modeling and mapping. However, additional molecular and quantitative methods are necessary to answer these public health-related questions.},

This study explored factors hindering the acceptability and use of available malaria preventive measures to better inform area specific strategies that can lead to malaria elimination. METHODS: Nine focus group discussions (FGD) covering a cross-section of 81 lay community members and local leaders were conducted in Ruhuha, Southern Eastern Rwanda in December 2013 to determine: community perceptions on malaria disease, acceptability of LLIN and IRS, health care-seeking behaviours and other malaria elimination strategies deployed at household and environmental levels. Discussions were recorded in Kinyarwanda, transcribed into English and coded using Nvivo 10 software. RESULTS: Participants ranked malaria as the top among five common diseases in the Ruhuha sector. Participants expressed comprehensive knowledge and understanding of malaria transmission and symptoms. The concept of malaria elimination was acknowledged, but challenges were reported. Sleeping under a bed net was negatively affected by increase of bedbugs (and the associated irritability) as well as discomfortable warmness particularly during the dry season. These two factors were reported as common hindrances of the use of LLIN. Also, widespread use of LLIN in constructing chicken pens or as fences around vegetable gardens was reported. Participants also reported that IRS appeared to lead to an increase in number of mosquitoes and other household bugs rather than kill them. Prompt health centre utilization among participants with presumed malaria was reported to be common particularly among subscribers to the subsidized community-based health insurance (CBHI) scheme. In contrast, the lack of CBHI and/or perceptions that health centre visits were time consuming were common reasons for the use of over-the-counter medicines for malaria management. CONCLUSION: In this study, identification of behavioural determinants in relation to LLIN use, IRS acceptability and health care seeking is a critical step in the development of effective, targeted interventions aiming to further reduce malaria transmission and elimination in the area.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between people's perception and utilization of public health services was investigated. METHODS: A survey of 840 households across selected urban, peri urban and rural communities, in the Southeast of Nigeria, was conducted using the mixed methods approach. RESULTS: Of the nine (9) demographic variables, only the locality and status of the health system (strong or weak in terms of child immunization) was found to influence both the poor rating and utilization of public health services. Individuals from states with strong health system rated relatively higher and used public health services more (p {\textless} 0.001), than their counterparts from states with weak health care system. Similarly, those in the urban or peri-urban localities used public health services more (p = 0.013). The two perceptual variables significantly influence the rating and use of public health services. Those with a good perception of the quality of health service provided, rated and patronized them more (p {\textless} 0.001). Also, health centres that provide a high number of services enjoyed greater rating and patronage (p {\textless} 0.001 and p = 0.0524 respectively). The results of the structured questionnaire survey were confirmed by qualitative enquiry,based on in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. CONCLUSIONS: It will be necessary to create a more responsive atmosphere in the health facilities, with culturally-sensitive and friendly health workers, and provision of affordable drug to improve the perceptions of the primary health care system, for it to succeed in providing health services for all.},

	abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and malaria are among the leading causes of morbidity during pregnancy. We reviewed available information collected since the first report 15 years ago that HIV impaired the ability of pregnant women to control malaria parasitemia. Results from 11 studies showed that HIV-infected women experienced consistently more peripheral and placental malaria (summary relative risk = 1.58 and 1.66, respectively), higher parasite densities, and more febrile illnesses, severe anemia, and adverse birth outcomes than HIV-uninfected women, particularly in multigravidae. Thus, HIV alters the typical gravidity-specific pattern of malaria risk by shifting the burden from primarily primigravidae and secundigravidae to all pregnant women. The proportional increase of malaria during pregnancy attributable to HIV was estimated to be 5.5\% and 18.8\% for populations with HIV prevalences of 10\% and 40\%, respectively. Maternal malaria was associated with a two-fold higher HIV-1 viral concentrations. Three studies investigating whether placental malaria increased mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission showed conflicting results, possibly reflecting a complex balance between placental malarial immune responses and stimulation of HIV-1 viral replication. Further investigations of interactions between antiretroviral drugs, prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole, and antimalarial drugs in pregnant women are urgently needed. Although much has been learned in the past 15 years about the interaction between malaria and HIV-1 during pregnancy, many issues still require further information to improve our understanding. There is a clear need to strengthen the deployment of existing malaria and HIV prevention and intervention measures for pregnant women.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases cause substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. These impacts are widely predicted to increase as temperatures warm and extreme precipitation events become more frequent, since mosquito biology and disease ecology are strongly linked to environmental conditions. However, direct evidence linking environmental change to changes in mosquito-borne disease is rare, and the ecological mechanisms that may underpin such changes are poorly understood. Environmental drivers, such as temperature, can have non-linear, opposing impacts on the demographic rates of different mosquito life cycle stages. As such, model frameworks that can deal with fluctuations in temperature explicitly are required to predict seasonal mosquito abundance, on which the intensity and persistence of disease transmission under different environmental scenarios depends. We present a novel, temperature-dependent, delay-differential equation model, which incorporates diapause and the differential effects of temperature on the duration and mortality of each life stage and demonstrates the sensitivity of seasonal abundance patterns to inter- and intra-annual changes in temperature. Likely changes in seasonal abundance and exposure to mosquitoes under projected changes in UK temperatures are presented, showing an increase in peak vector abundance with warming that potentially increases the risk of disease outbreaks.},

We extend the model to focus on the effects of condom use as a single strategy approach in HIV prevention in the absence of any other intervention strategies. Initially, we model the use of male condoms, followed by incorporating the use of both the female and male condoms. The model includes two primary factors in condom use to control HIV which are condom efficacy and compliance. Reproductive numbers for these models are computed and compared to assess the effectiveness of male and female condom use in a community. We also extend the basic model to consider the effects of antiretroviral therapy as a single strategy. The results from the study show that condoms can reduce the number of secondary infectives and thus can slow the development of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Further, we note from the study that treatment of AIDS patients may enlarge the epidemic when the treatment drugs are not 100\% effective and when treated AIDS patients indulge in risky sexual behaviour. Thus, the treatment with amelioration of AIDS patients should be accompanied with intense public health educational programs, which are capable of changing the attitude of treated AIDS patients towards safe sex. It is also shown from the study that the use of condoms in settings with the treatment may help in reducing the number of secondary infections thus slowing the epidemic.},

The study was performed by modeling a clinical decision tree based on a hypothetical 1,000 adult uncomplicated falciparum malaria cases. Key variables were (i) three drug regimes: CQ, SP and MFQ, (ii) three categories of therapeutic efficacy of each drug: adequate clinical response (ACR), early treatment failure (ETF) and late treatment failure (LTF) according to the 1996 WHO protocol, and (iii) compliance with each drug. In structuring the model, necessary assumptions were made. The cost effectiveness was measured as cost per case cured and cost per case prevented death related to the provided drug, from the provider's perspective. According to the present price and therapeutic efficacy, SP is the most cost effective drug for a case cured in all three categories of efficacy (US\$ 0.12 per case cured in ACR, US\$ 0.38 per case cured in ETF and US\$ 0.54 per case cured in LTF). For a case prevented death, CQ is most cost effective in all three categories (US\$ 0.58 per case prevented death in the ACR, US\$ 2.14 per case prevented death in the ETF and US\$ 2.51 per case prevented death in the LTF).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Large-cage experiments indicate pyriproxifen (PPF) can be transferred from resting sites to aquatic habitats by Anopheles arabiensis–malaria vector mosquitoes to inhibit emergence of their own offspring. PPF coverage is amplified twice: (1) partial coverage of resting sites with PPF contamination results in far higher contamination coverage of adult mosquitoes because they are mobile and use numerous resting sites per gonotrophic cycle, and (2) even greater contamination coverage of aquatic habitats results from accumulation of PPF from multiple oviposition events. METHODS AND FINDINGS:Deterministic mathematical models are described that use only field-measurable input parameters and capture the biological processes that mediate PPF autodissemination. Recent successes in large cages can be rationalized, and the plausibility of success under full field conditions can be evaluated a priori. The model also defines measurable properties of PPF delivery prototypes that may be optimized under controlled experimental conditions to maximize chances of success in full field trials. The most obvious flaw in this model is the endogenous relationship that inevitably occurs between the larval habitat coverage and the measured rate of oviposition into those habitats if the target mosquito species is used to mediate PPF transfer. However, this inconsistency also illustrates the potential advantages of using a different, non-target mosquito species for contamination at selected resting sites that shares the same aquatic habitats as the primary target. For autodissemination interventions to eliminate malaria transmission or vector populations during the dry season window of opportunity will require comprehensive contamination of the most challenging subset of aquatic habitats [Formula: see text] that persist or retain PPF activity (Ux) for only one week [Formula: see text], where Ux = 7 days). To achieve {\textgreater}99\% contamination coverage of these habitats will necessitate values for the product of the proportional coverage of the ovipositing mosquito population with PPF contamination (CM) by the ovitrap-detectable rates of oviposition by wild mosquitoes into this subset of habitats [Formula: see text], divided by the titre of contaminated mosquitoes required to render them unproductive [Formula: see text], that approximately approach unity [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS:The simple multiplicative relationship between CM and [Formula: see text], and the simple exponential decay effect they have upon uncontaminated aquatic habitats, allows application of this model by theoreticians and field biologists alike.},

	abstract = {Malaria creates serious health and economic problems which call for integrated management strategies to disrupt interactions among mosquitoes, the parasite and humans. In order to reduce the intensity of malaria transmission, malaria vector control may be implemented to protect individuals against infective mosquito bites. As a sustainable larval control method, the use of larvivorous fish is promoted in some circumstances. To evaluate the potential impacts of this biological control measure on malaria transmission, we propose and investigate a mathematical model describing the linked dynamics between the host-vector interaction and the predator-prey interaction. The model, which consists of five ordinary differential equations, is rigorously analysed via theories and methods of dynamical systems. We derive four biologically plausible and insightful quantities (reproduction numbers) that completely determine the community composition. Our results suggest that the introduction of larvivorous fish can, in principle, have important consequences for malaria dynamics, but also indicate that this would require strong predators on larval mosquitoes. Integrated strategies of malaria control are analysed to demonstrate the biological application of our developed theory.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental and ecological studies have shown the role of climatic factors in driving the epidemiology of influenza. In particular, low absolute humidity (AH) has been shown to increase influenza virus transmissibility and has been identified to explain the onset of epidemics in temperate regions. Here, we aim to study the potential climatic drivers of influenza-like illness (ILI) epidemiology in Vietnam, a tropical country characterized by a high diversity of climates. We specifically focus on quantifying and explaining the seasonality of ILI. METHODS: We used 18 years (1993-2010) of monthly ILI notifications aggregated by province (52) and monthly climatic variables (minimum, mean, maximum temperatures, absolute and relative humidities, rainfall and hours of sunshine) from 67 weather stations across Vietnam. Seasonalities were quantified from global wavelet spectra, using the value of the power at the period of 1 year as a measure of the intensity of seasonality. The 7 climatic time series were characterized by 534 summary statistics which were entered into a regression tree to identify factors associated with the seasonality of AH. Results were extrapolated to the global scale using simulated climatic times series from the NCEP/NCAR project. RESULTS: The intensity of ILI seasonality in Vietnam is best explained by the intensity of AH seasonality. We find that ILI seasonality is weak in provinces experiencing weak seasonal fluctuations in AH (annual power 17.6). In Vietnam, AH and ILI are positively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify a role for AH in driving the epidemiology of ILI in a tropical setting. However, in contrast to temperate regions, high rather than low AH is associated with increased ILI activity. Fluctuation in AH may be the climate factor that underlies and unifies the seasonality of ILI in both temperate and tropical regions. Alternatively, the mechanism of action of AH on disease transmission may be different in cold-dry versus hot-humid settings.},

	abstract = {Land-use change is the main force behind ecological and social change in many countries around the globe; it is primarily driven by resource needs and external economic incentives. Concomitantly, transformations of the land are the main drivers for the emergence and re-emergence of malaria. An understanding of malaria population dynamics in transforming landscapes is lacking, despite its relevance for developmental and public health policies. We develop a mathematical model that couples malaria epidemiology with the socio-economic and demographic processes that occur in a landscape undergoing land-use change. This allows us to identify different types of malaria dynamics that can arise in early stages of this transformation. In particular, we show that an increase in transmission followed by either a decline, or a further enhancement, of risk is a common outcome. This increase results from the asymmetry between the relatively fast ecological changes in transformed landscapes, and the slower pace of investment in malaria protection. These results underscore the importance of reducing ecological risk, while providing services and economic opportunities to early migrants for longer periods. Consideration of these socio-ecological processes and, more importantly, the temporal scale on which they act, is critical to avoid potential bifurcations that lead to long-lasting endemic malaria.},

Anopheles leucosphyrous group mosquitoes transmit the parasite and natural hosts include long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques. Despite early laboratory experiments demonstrating successful passage of infection between humans, the true role that humans play in P. knowlesi epidemiology remains unclear. The threat posed by its introduction into immunologically naïve populations is unknown despite being a public health priority for this region. A two-host species mathematical model was constructed to analyse this threat. Global sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo methods highlighted the biological processes of greatest influence to transmission. These included parameters known to be influential in classic mosquito-borne disease models (e.g. vector longevity); however, interesting ecological components that are specific to this system were also highlighted: while local vectors likely have intrinsic preferences for certain host species, how plastic these preferences are, and how this is shaped by local conditions, are key determinants of parasite transmission potential. Invasion analysis demonstrates that this behavioural plasticity can qualitatively impact the probability of an epidemic sparked by imported infection. Identifying key vector sub/species and studying their biting behaviours constitute important next steps before models can better assist in strategizing disease control.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza is a major public health concern in vulnerable populations. Here we investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (VIS410) against Influenza A in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Based on these results and preclinical data, we implemented a mathematical modeling approach to investigate whether VIS410 could be used prophylactically to lessen the burden of a seasonal influenza epidemic and to protect at-risk groups from associated complications. METHODS: Using a single-ascending dose study (n = 41) at dose levels from 2 mg/kg-50 mg/kg we evaluated the safety as well as the serum and upper respiratory pharmacokinetics of a broadly-neutralizing antibody (VIS410) against influenza A (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02045472). Our primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of VIS410 compared to placebo. We developed an epidemic microsimulation model testing the ability of VIS410 to mitigate attack rates and severe disease in at risk-populations. FINDINGS: VIS410 was found to be generally safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels, from 2-50 mg/kg. Overall, 27 of 41 subjects (65.9\%) reported a total of 67 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). TEAEs were reported by 20 of 30 subjects (66.7\%) who received VIS410 and by 7 of 11 subjects (63.6\%) who received placebo. 14 of 16 TEAEs related to study drug were considered mild (Grade 1) and 2 were moderate (Grade 2). Two subjects (1 subject who received 30 mg/kg VIS410 and 1 subject who received placebo) experienced serious AEs (Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs) that were not related to study drug. VIS410 exposure was approximately dose-proportional with a mean half-life of 12.9 days. Mean VIS410 Cmax levels in the upper respiratory tract were 20.0 and 25.3 mug/ml at the 30 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses, respectively, with corresponding serum Cmax levels of 980.5 and 1316 mug/mL. Using these pharmacokinetic data, a microsimulation model showed that median attack rate reductions ranged from 8.6\% (interquartile range (IQR): 4.7\%-11.0\%) for 2\% coverage to 22.6\% (IQR: 12.7-30.0\%) for 6\% coverage. The overall benefits to the elderly, a vulnerable subgroup, are largest when VIS410 is distributed exclusively to elderly individuals, resulting in reductions in hospitalization rates between 11.4\% (IQR: 8.2\%-13.3\%) for 2\% coverage and 30.9\% (IQR: 24.8\%-35.1\%) for 6\% coverage among those more than 65 years of age. INTERPRETATION: VIS410 was generally safe and well tolerated and had good relative exposure in both serum and upper respiratory tract, supporting its use as either a single-dose therapeutic or prophylactic for influenza A. Including VIS410 prophylaxis among the public health interventions for seasonal influenza has the potential to lower attack rates and substantially reduce hospitalizations in individuals over the age of 65.

We have developed a C++ based, stochastic spatially explicit model (ANOSPEX; Ano pheles Spatially-Explicit) to simulate Anopheles metapopulation dynamics. The model is biologically rich, parameterized by field data, and driven by field-collected weather data from Macha, Zambia. To preliminarily validate ANOSPEX, simulation results were compared to field mosquito collection data from Macha; simulated and observed dynamics were similar. The ANOSPEX model will be useful in a predictive and exploratory manner to develop, evaluate and implement traditional and novel strategies to control malaria, and for understanding the environmental forces driving Anopheles population dynamics.},

Bone marrow rapidly responded after parasite clearance. The rapid drop in hematocrit despite extremely low to undetectable parasitemia indicated massive removal of uninfected red blood cells from the circulation that, in the presence of bone marrow dysfunction, led to severe anemia-the problem that occurs in African children. We demonstrate that Aotus monkeys are a nonhuman primate model to gain insight into the pathogenesis of severe anemia in African children.},

	abstract = {Morbidity and mortality from malaria remain unacceptably high among young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Intermittent preventive treatment in infancy (IPTi) involves the administration of antimalarials alongside routine vaccinations and might be an option in malaria control. In an area of intense, perennial malaria transmission in northern Ghana, 1,200 children received IPTi with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or placebo at approximately 3, 9, and 15 months of age. Children were followed up until 24 months of age to assess morbidity and adverse events. During the intervention period (3 to 18 months of age), IPTi reduced the incidences of malaria and severe anemia by 22.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 12 to 32\%) and 23.6\% (95\% confidence interval, 4 to 39\%), respectively, and reduced hospitalizations and episodes of asymptomatic parasitemia by one-third. Protection was pronounced in the first year of life and not discernible in the second. The malaria-protective effect was largely confined to a period of 1 month after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatments. Following the intervention, protection against asymptomatic parasitemia persisted. In contrast, a significant rebound of severe malaria, predominantly severe malarial anemia, occurred among children having received IPTi. Although the treatment was generally well tolerated, one case of moderately severe skin reaction followed sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment. IPTi reduces malaria and anemia in infants in northern Ghana. Extension of IPTi into the second year of life by administering a dose at 15 months of age provided no substantial benefit beyond a 1-month prophylactic effect. Although this simple intervention offers one of the few available malaria-preventive measures for regions where malaria is endemic, the observed rebound of severe malaria advises caution and requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many recent studies have examined the impact of urbanization on Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity and found a general trend of reduced transmission in urban areas. However, none has examined the effect of urbanization on Plasmodium vivax malaria, which is the most widely distributed malaria species and can also cause severe clinical syndromes in humans. In this study, a set of 10,003 community-based P. vivax parasite rate (PvPR) surveys are used to explore the relationships between PvPR in urban and rural settings. METHODS: The PvPR surveys were overlaid onto a map of global urban extents to derive an urban/rural assignment. The differences in PvPR values between urban and rural areas were then examined. Groups of PvPR surveys inside individual city extents (urban) and surrounding areas (rural) were identified to examine the local variations in PvPR values. Finally, the relationships of PvPR between urban and rural areas within the ranges of 41 dominant Anopheles vectors were examined. RESULTS: Significantly higher PvPR values in rural areas were found globally. The relationship was consistent at continental scales when focusing on Africa and Asia only, but in the Americas, significantly lower values of PvPR in rural areas were found, though the numbers of surveys were small. Moreover, except for the countries in the Americas, the same trends were found at national scales in African and Asian countries, with significantly lower values of PvPR in urban areas. However, the patterns at city scales among 20 specific cities where sufficient data were available were less clear, with seven cities having significantly lower PvPR values in urban areas and two cities showing significantly lower PvPR in rural areas. The urban-rural PvPR differences within the ranges of the dominant Anopheles vectors were generally, in agreement with the regional patterns found. CONCLUSIONS: Except for the Americas, the patterns of significantly lower P. vivax transmission in urban areas have been found globally, regionally, nationally and by dominant vector species here, following trends observed previously for P. falciparum. To further understand these patterns, more epidemiological, entomological and parasitological analyses of the disease at smaller spatial scales are needed.},

After a short account of smallpox inoculation and of Bernoulli's life, the motivation for that paper and its impact are described. It determines the age-specific equilibrium prevalence of immune individuals in an endemic potentially lethal infectious disease. The gain in life expectancy after elimination of this cause of death can be explicitly expressed in terms of the case fatality and the endemic prevalence of susceptibles. D'Alembert developed in 1761 an alternative method for dealing with competing risks of death, which is also applicable to non-infectious diseases. Bernoulli's formula for the endemic prevalence of susceptibles has so far escaped attention. It involves the lifetime risk of the infection, the force of infection and the life expectancy at birth. A new formula for the basic reproduction number is derived which involves the average force of infection, the average case fatality and the life expectancy at the time of infection. One can use this estimate to assess the gain in life expectancy if only a fraction of the population is immunized.},

There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial vector control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread. The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection and its public health burden are poorly known. Here we undertake an exhaustive assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall, temperature and the degree of urbanization. Using cartographic approaches, we estimate there to be 390 million (95\% credible interval 284-528) dengue infections per year, of which 96 million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of disease severity). This infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the World Health Organization. Stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison with national dengue reporting, after taking into account the probability of an apparent infection being formally reported. The most notable differences are discussed. These new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into the global, regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue. We anticipate that they will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about the global impact of this disease and will help to guide improvements in disease control strategies using vaccine, drug and vector control methods, and in their economic evaluation.},

	abstract = {Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2-to end preventable child deaths by 2030-we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000-2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32\% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58\% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The persistence of malaria in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa has motivated the development of novel tools to complement existing control programmes, including gene-drive technologies to modify mosquito vector populations. Here, we use a stochastic simulation model to explore the potential of using a driving-Y chromosome to suppress vector populations in a 106 km2 area of West Africa including all of Burkina Faso. RESULTS: The consequence of driving-Y introductions is predicted to vary across the landscape, causing elimination of the target species in some regions and suppression in others. We explore how this variation is determined by environmental conditions, mosquito behaviour, and the properties of the gene-drive. Seasonality is particularly important, and we find population elimination is more likely in regions with mild dry seasons whereas suppression is more likely in regions with strong seasonality. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the spatial heterogeneity, we suggest that repeated introductions of modified mosquitoes over a few years into a small fraction of human settlements may be sufficient to substantially reduce the overall number of mosquitoes across the entire geographic area.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has set the goals of gambiense-HAT elimination as a public health problem for 2020, and of interruption of transmission to humans for 2030. Latent human infections and possible animal reservoirs may challenge these goals. It remains largely unknown whether, and to what extend, they have an impact on gambiense-HAT transmission.

We investigate the impact that different mixing assumptions have on the spread an infectious disease in an age-structured ordinary differential equation model. We consider the impact of heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity within the population on the disease transmission. We apply the analysis to the spread of a smallpox-like disease, derive the formula for the reproduction number, 0, and based on this threshold parameter, show the level of human behavioral change required to control the epidemic. We analyze how different mixing patterns can affect the disease prevalence, the cumulative number of new infections, and the final epidemic size. Our analysis indicates that the combination of residual immunity and behavioral changes during a smallpox-like disease outbreak can play a key role in halting infectious disease spread; and that realistic mixing patterns must be included in the epidemic model for the predictions to accurately reflect reality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) is underway, yet two key programmatic features are currently still lacking: (1) the extension of efforts to all lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic countries, and (2) the expansion of geographic coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) within countries. For varying levels of scale-up of MDA, we assessed the health benefits and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with LF eradication, projected the potential savings due to decreased morbidity management needs, and estimated potential household productivity gains as a result of reduced LF-related morbidity. METHODS: We extended an LF transmission model to track hydrocele and lymphoedema incidence in order to obtain estimates of the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted due to scaling up MDA over a period of 50 years. We then estimated the ICERs and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves associated with different rates of MDA scale-up. Health systems savings were estimated by considering the averted morbidity, treatment-seeking behaviour and morbidity management costs. Gains in worker productivity were estimated by multiplying estimated working days lost as a result of morbidity with country-specific per-worker agricultural wages. RESULTS: Our projections indicate that a massive scaling-up of MDA could lead to 4.38 million incremental DALYs averted over a 50-year time horizon compared to a scenario which mirrors current efforts against LF. In comparison to maintaining the current rate of progress against LF, massive scaling-up of MDA-pursuing LF eradication as soon as possible-was most likely to be cost-effective above a willingness to pay threshold of US\$71.5/DALY averted. Intensified MDA scale-up was also associated with lower ICERs. Furthermore, this could result in health systems savings up to US\$483 million. Extending coverage to all endemic areas could generate additional economic benefits through gains in worker productivity between US\$3.4 and US\$14.4 billion. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to ethical and political motivations for scaling-up MDA rapidly, this analysis provides economic support for increasing the intensity of MDA programmes.},

A related concern regards the evolution of host-seeking periodicity from the nocturnal to the crepuscular periods of the day. Why we observe such shifts in some areas but not others and which methods could prove useful in managing such behavioral resistance remain open questions. We developed a foraging model to explore whether environmental conditions affect the evolution of behavioral resistance. We looked at the role of the abundance of blood hosts and nectar sources and investigated the potential of attractive toxic sugar baits for integrated control. Higher encounter rates with hosts and nectar sources allowed behaviorally resistant populations to persist at higher levels of bed net coverage. Whereas higher encounter rates with nectar increased the threshold where resistance emerged, higher encounter rates of hosts lowered this threshold. Adding sugar baits lowered the coverage level of bed nets required to eliminate the vector population. In certain environments, using lower bed net coverage levels together with toxic sugar baits may delay or prevent the evolution of behavioral resistance. Designing sustainable control strategies will depend on an understanding of vector behavior expressed in local environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: In areas where malaria transmission has been suppressed by vector control interventions many malaria control and elimination programmes are actively seeking new interventions to further reduce malaria prevalence, incidence and transmission. Malaria infection prevalence and incidence has been shown to cluster geographically, especially at lower transmission levels, and as such a reactive strategy is frequently used, by which index cases presenting to a passive surveillance system are used to target small areas for testing and treatment, reactive case detection (RCD), or focal drug administration (fDA). This study utilizes geo-located data from a census with parasitological testing with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and treatment-seeking data collection conducted in southern Zambia to estimate the coverage of RCD or fDA in terms of the population and parasite reservoir as well as the operational requirements of such strategies, using a re-sampling algorithm developed exclusively for this purpose. This re-sampling algorithm allows for the specification of several parameters, such that different operational variants of these reactive strategies can be examined, including varying the search radius, screening for fever, or presumptive treatment (fDA). RESULTS: Results indicate that RCD, fDA and active fever screening followed by RCD, even with search radii over several hundered meters will only yield limited coverage of the RDT positive parasite reservoir during a short period. Long-term use of these strategies may increase this proportion. Reactive strategies detect a higher proportion of the reservoir of infections than random searches, but this effect appears to be greater in areas of low, but not moderate malaria prevalence in southern Zambia. DISCUSSION: Increases in the sensitivity of RDTs could also affect these results. The number of individuals and households that need to be searched increase rapidly, but approximately linearly with search radius. CONCLUSIONS: Reactive strategies in southern Zambia yield improved identification of the parasite reservoir when targeted to areas with prevalence less than 10\%. The operational requirements of delivering reactive strategies routinely are likely to prevent their uptake until prevalence falls far below this level.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY: Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) exist naturally in many single-celled organisms and can show extremely strong genetic drive allowing them to spread through populations into which they are introduced. They are being investigated as tools to manipulate the populations of important vectors of human disease, in particular the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. Before HEGs can be deployed, it is important to study their spatial spread in order to design efficient release strategies.A spatially explicit model is developed to study the spread of a HEG through a landscape whose structure is defined by the distribution of mosquito breeding and feeding sites. The model is motivated by the biology of the major vectors of malaria in Africa. The conditions for spread, fixation and loss of two major types of HEG are explored in different landscapes.In landscapes where mosquito resources are abundant, the conditions for spread are well approximated by a mean-field model. Where a HEG imposes a genetic load, it can cause population extinction, though spatial models more often predict population suppression.In certain types of landscapes where mosquito resources are rare, an introduced HEG may be prevented from moving between local mosquito populations and so a simple release strategy is unlikely to be effective, yet if the HEG succeeds in spreading population extinction is a feasible outcome. Increasing the number of release sites at the expense of releasing fewer mosquitoes per site reduces the probability that a HEG will fail.Synthesis and applications. The model presented asks for the first time how the spatial structure of mosquito populations will influence the effectiveness of a technology that is being rapidly developed for vector control. If homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are to be used in this way, we have qualified the importance of accounting for landscape characteristics in both the execution and the expectation of their application. The next stage is to use the model to study the spread of HEGs through real landscapes where releases may take place, something that will be facilitated by the results of the present study.},

	abstract = {The Global Malaria Action Plan (GMAP), a consensus framework for coordinated action, aims to end malaria deaths by 2015 and eventually to eradicate malaria ([ 1 ][1]). The plan calls for universal access to effective antimalarial drugs and universal coverage with appropriate vector interventions. Strategic planning for how best to reach these goals has been left to individual countries, some of which have already made plans to eliminate malaria, i.e., to rid their countries of malaria parasites and to suppress transmission from imported malaria (travelers carrying malaria infections from one region into another) so that locally acquired cases are rare ([ 2 ][2]). Critics have argued that plans for national elimination distract attention and resources from the priority of reducing malaria's heavy burden in sub-Saharan Africa ([ 3 ][3]) and that a better strategy would be “control,” i.e., reducing malaria to a minor public health problem. These sides reflect the bipolar history of antimalaria efforts. When funding collapsed for a previous attempt to eradicate malaria, control defined the malaria agenda through decades of neglect. Control and elimination are often presented as opposite sides of a debate over how to allocate billions of dollars allocated globally for malaria aid. But a recent study in Zanzibar ([ 4 ][4]) concluded the dichotomy was false. A more urgent problem is continuity. How can enthusiasm for funding malaria be sustained? Since 2002, Zanzibar has scaled up intervention coverage and sharply reduced malaria ([ 5 ][5], [ 6 ][6]). Zanzibar must now decide how to consolidate success, as other countries that succeed in reducing malaria must also do. To help set an appropriate strategy, Zanzibar commissioned a report to assess the feasibility of malaria elimination ([ 4 ][4]), with the goal of comparing requirements for elimination and control (i.e., sustaining current interventions). Elimination would allow Zanzibar to scale back some interventions and, once malaria was sufficiently rare, to transition to a system of active case detection and outbreak response ([ 4 ][4]). This would require substantial intensification of surveillance and building capacity but increase costs from the current control program by less than \$1 per capita ([ 7 ][7]). If imported malaria cases dropped, costs would also decline, and elimination would then cost less than control. Despite operational differences, long-term implications of both strategies were found to be similar. In both cases, interventions had to be maintained to prevent imported malaria from leading to a resumption of local transmission. In other words, the conclusion was not that control or elimination would be a better strategy; it was that regardless of what Zanzibar chooses to do, malaria will remain a threat for many years. The problem remains: how to continue funding a program to manage the risk of resurgence that will persist until the threat of malaria is gone. Zanzibar has been at these crossroads before. The capital, Stone Town, was called a “hot bed of malaria” ([ 8 ][8]). Zanzibar had reduced malaria to very low levels by 1969 ([ 9 ][9]), but with malaria no longer a visible threat to health, interventions were abandoned in 1970. Maintaining a minimal malaria burden despite the continued presence of mosquitoes and other conditions that make an area receptive to malaria requires active suppression of transmission, so malaria returned to levels seen before control (see the graph, opposite page). In 2002, before scale-up of interventions, malaria transmission in Zanzibar was as intense as anywhere in Africa. Without maintaining programs that minimize the burden today, malaria would return again to Zanzibar. This history recalls the myth of Sisyphus, who was forced by Zeus to push a boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down and therefore suffer an eternity of frustration. Malaria's curse is caused by a common, but pernicious, public health conundrum: the greater the success in suppressing an infectious disease, the lower the perceived threat, and the more challenging it becomes to maintain funding and to sustain control. Zanzibar's success shows what is possible and can help build enthusiasm and support for reducing malaria elsewhere. However, the challenge of sustaining success against an imminent but invisible threat must be solved. Failure in Zanzibar would raise questions about the long-term prospects elsewhere in Africa. Zanzibar's dilemma will soon arise in each region that is newly successful in reducing the burden of malaria with the help of donor funding; the uncertainties in Zanzibar are the uncertainties of our global malaria strategy. Zanzibar's malaria funding is once again threatened. International donors are considering the allocation of limited budgets against the few thousand malaria cases that still occur there. The islands are home to only 1.2 million people out of 678 million Africans at risk of malaria ([ 10 ][10]), most of whom also require malaria interventions under the GMAP. Yet the belief that it is possible to shift malaria funds away from Zanzibar arises from basic misunderstandings. First, intensive interventions must remain in place to suppress transmission, or malaria will rapidly return to its highly endemic and high burden baseline, just as it has in the past (see the graph). By analogy, measles epidemics are inevitable if vaccination coverage declines. Malaria interventions must become standard public health interventions, like vaccines. Second, it makes no sense to stop protecting 1.2 million Zanzibaris now that the program has achieved success. Because the costs of reducing malaria greatly depend on drugs, nets, insecticides, and other fixed-price commodities, budgets are roughly proportional to population size, and moving money from Zanzibar would simply protect an equivalent number of citizens in a more populous country. Reshuffling resources among countries, repeatedly sacrificing hard-earned gains to chase new ones, would indeed curse all of Africa with the Sisyphean malaria cycles seen in Zanzibar. ![Figure][11] A plot of malaria parasite surveys in Zanzibar since 1957. Large regional or national surveys (large symbols) and smaller localized surveys (small symbols) of Unguja (purple), Pemba (green), or the entire archipelago (black). Prevalence estimates reported from various age ranges have been standardized to children aged 2 to 10 years ([ 15 ][12]). The first intensive program was part of the Global Malaria Eradication Program (GMEP). The second intensive program, conducted during the 1990s by the Zanzibar Malaria Control Programme (ZMCP) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), halved prevalence but did not come close to elimination. No extensive surveys were conducted on Unguja until after the current intensive program began. The time span of the three control programs is less shaded. The current intensive program is sponsored by the ZMCP, the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative (PMI); and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM). (See SOM for details such as error bars.) Finally, it is a mistake to judge the return on malaria investments in relation to the current burden of malaria. A facile weighting of the millions invested in malaria interventions against a few remaining cases produces the erroneous conclusion that those funds are achieving little. The true value of these investments is the number of deaths and cases that are prevented, not that remain. In Zanzibar each year, benefits include prevention of ∼660,000 malaria cases and 3300 malaria-attributable deaths that occurred before control; at the current average control cost of \$3.9 million per year ([ 11 ][13]), this translates into \$1183 per death averted and \$34.5 per disability-adjusted life year averted, in line with the world's most cost-effective public health interventions {\textbackslash}textbackslash[supporting online material (SOM){\textbackslash}textbackslash] ([ 12 ][14]). In Zanzibar, sustained implementation of malaria interventions that make this possible continues to save lives, and it is as cost-effective to continue programs there as it would be to implement a new program at a cost of \$3.9 million per year to prevent nearly 660,000 cases each year somewhere else. For Africa to replicate the success seen in Zanzibar and to achieve the goals of the GMAP, funding levels must match or exceed the current per-capita spending levels in Zanzibar; this investment amounts to at least \$2.2 billion per year to cover 678 million Africans at risk ([ 10 ][10]). The GMAP estimates that almost \$6 billion per year are required globally, but total commitments currently amount to less than \$2 billion per year ([ 13 ][15]). The crux of the problem is that current funding levels are too low to fulfill the GMAP goal of scaling up coverage levels everywhere it is needed, but malaria interventions cannot be scaled back in places like Zanzibar while the threat of malaria remains. The obvious answer is that more money is needed over the next funding cycles to secure the gains that have been made while extending malaria control to new regions. With the severe resource constraints that currently exist, however, the global malaria community needs to define a coherent and efficient long-term strategy. Zanzibar's elimination feasibility report ([ 4 ][4]) points to one viable path, only if the threat of malaria resurgence diminishes. Without renewed transmission from endemic pockets of malaria within the borders or large numbers of imported infections from abroad, countries could scale back current interventions and adopt a system of surveillance and outbreak response. Zanzibar's costs would also be reduced by suppressing malaria transmission in nearby Kenya and Tanzania to reduce imported malaria ([ 4 ][4]). Reducing malaria creates a benefit for neighbors that did not pay for it. Scaling up interventions in regionally coordinated programs, such as those implemented in Southern Africa and Southeast Asia, could increase malaria security for every country in the region, reinforce national success, reduce overall costs, and minimize risks. These regional control zones could be expanded, with additional funds leapfrogged to new countries to advance the front. Through such a spatially progressive approach ([ 14 ][16]), funds could be shifted from successful countries in a strategic, logical way without incurring enormous risks. Zanzibar's achievement must be sustained and integrated into a coherent long-term continental strategy that shrinks Africa's malaria map ([ 14 ][16]). Implementing these programs will require stable long-term funding commitments from donors to sustain the effort over several decades. Countries also must do their part and eventually reduce their reliance on external funding for their malaria programs through predictable domestic funding mechanisms such as an earmarked tax or trust funds ([ 4 ][4]). Malaria endemic countries are not fated to watch their triumph collapse back into failure. Zanzibar's early success shows what can be achieved in Africa. It has proven it can efficiently utilize international resources to reduce malaria dramatically, but funding must be sustained for the next decade or more until a permanent solution to the malaria problem is found. Funders need only to realize that success is possible and that building on the gains being made today is one of the best deals in global health.

	abstract = {When the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP) was launched in 1955 ([ 1 ][1], [ 2 ][2]), all malaria-endemic countries outside of Africa were (or would soon be) eliminating malaria ([ 3 ][3]). The GMEP's design was based on a theory of malaria transmission dynamics and control that has become the standard for malaria elimination decisions today ([ 4 ][4]–[ 6 ][5]). When financial support for the GMEP collapsed in 1969, participating countries were caught at different stages of progress toward elimination ([ 1 ][1]). Examining their fate in the decades that followed provides a natural experiment that tests the theory. With a rise in funding ([ 7 ][6]) and renewed interest in eradication ([ 8 ][7], [ 9 ][8]), there is now a need to revisit the lessons learned from the GMEP. We identify changes in the epidemiology of malaria when elimination is reached that could explain its stability and discuss how this calls for a reassessment of strategies for eradication. Malaria elimination involves stopping transmission in a defined region until no parasites remain ([ 6 ][5], [ 10 ][9]), through implementation of vector control, treatment of infected individuals, and other available interventions. Eradication is elimination at a global scale. Between 1945 and 2010, 79 countries eliminated malaria and 75 (95\%) remained malaria-free ([ 11 ][10]), which shrank the geographical range of malaria ([ 12 ][11]). A recent review identified 75 resurgent malaria transmission events in 61 countries ([ 13 ][12]), which included marked increases in malaria incidence in 36 of the 49 countries (73\%) that had participated in the GMEP but had failed to reach elimination ([ 11 ][10], [ 14 ][13]). Resurgent malaria after the GMEP confirms some predictions of the standard theory, but elsewhere, the apparent stability of elimination is counterintuitive and may require a reappraisal of the theory. It suggests that elimination could be a way to solve the Sisyphean problem of malaria ([ 15 ][14]). Standard theory for malaria elimination is based on a threshold concept called R ([ 4 ][4], [ 5 ][15]), the expected number of secondary infections produced by each infected human in the absence of control or acquired immunity. R is a threshold condition because each case must cause at least one other case to have sustained transmission and endemic malaria. Mosquito aspects of R are described by vectorial capacity, a single number that summarizes mosquito population density, longevity, blood-feeding habits, human-feeding preferences, and parasite development rates ([ 16 ][16]). Human aspects of R are dominated by the long infectious period that is sustained by untreated asymptomatic infections lasting 6 to 8 months on average and, sometimes, longer than a year ([ 17 ][17]). Vector control reduces vectorial capacity; routine use of antimalarial drugs shortens infections; and, in the presence of such interventions, controlled reproductive numbers, denoted R C, describe the reduced number of malaria cases arising from each malaria case ([ 9 ][8]). Elimination requires reducing R C to R C estimates by year (1998–2002) for 27 GMEP countries that eliminated malaria. Elimination requires reducing R C to 1), and they have remained malaria-free even though most of these countries have abandoned the elimination era vector-control programs. Without those interventions in place, why has transmission not resumed? Considering that all of these countries face ongoing malaria importation, the stability of elimination requires a closer look. To assess contemporary malaria importation and to quantify R C in elimination countries, national malaria reporting data were sought from 1980 onward for all countries that participated in the GMEP and eliminated malaria [see supplementary materials (SM)]. In many cases, the data were either sporadically or not collected or not publicly reported. Data were found for 30 countries that eliminated malaria, documenting 249,250 imported malaria cases over 596 country-years versus 4993 introduced (acquired by mosquito transmission from an imported case) or otherwise locally acquired. Formulas from branching theory were used to estimate R C ([ 10 ][9]). The overall yearly average was R C \${\textbackslash}approx\$ 0.04, and ∼85\% (506 out of 596) of year-by-country R C estimates were less than 0.01 (see the chart). Because these countries once sustained endemic transmission, this analysis suggests that, for 85\% of country-years, transmission is proportionally lower by a factor of more than 100 (i.e., R / R C {\textgreater} 100). Elimination has become highly stable. This familiar, but often overlooked, pattern suggests that elimination has substantial advantages over the alternative strategy of minimizing the burden indefinitely without attempting to eliminate malaria, which faces the challenge of financing and distributing interventions to suppress transmission and to manage an ever-present but inapparent threat ([ 15 ][14]). Understanding the causes of very low R C values in elimination countries is crucial to an assessment of the potential for malaria elimination to become a stable endpoint elsewhere. Important questions remain as to how the 99 countries with endemic malaria should weigh their technical and operational challenges ([ 20 ][21], [ 21 ][22]) and assess the feasibility of and formulate plans for malaria elimination ([ 22 ][23]). There are six main nonexclusive hypotheses for the stability of elimination after top-down control was ceased. (i) R might have decreased because of indirect effects of economic development wholly unrelated to disease control, such as changes in mosquito ecology or human demography resulting in reduced human-vector contact; (ii) a decline in R C might have caused economic development, which then reduced R ([ 23 ][24]); (iii) R C is low because countries have maintained vector-control programs (this is likely true only in few countries); (iv) R C is low because country health systems have exerted highly effective control through routine surveillance and case management combined with outbreak control; (v) vector control permanently altered vector ecology and R ; and (vi) the stability of elimination is partly due to travel patterns and the destinations of imported malaria. All six hypotheses could explain some portion of the 100-fold difference in R C to varying degrees in different countries. The appropriate plan for countries contemplating elimination depends on the causes of the stability. A critical determination is whether elimination was caused by external changes in R unrelated to control efforts or whether elimination itself caused the permanent declines in R and/or reductions in R C. If malaria elimination requires an external change in R (such as exogenous economic development), then control measures will need to be maintained until a transition occurs. If, instead, elimination itself causes stability through economic development and/or other means, then elimination is a highly desirable endpoint and should be aggressively pursued and supported. It is possible that one part of the mechanism by which development produces stability is through improved health systems and surveillance; if so, then improving health systems may be a necessary part of elimination. Our analysis from post-elimination countries documenting large declines in R or R C—whatever the cause—suggests that eradication of malaria differs from smallpox and other vaccine-preventable, directly transmitted diseases ([ 24 ][25]). It has been argued that eradication is all-or-nothing, that interventions must remain in place until eradication has been achieved, and that there is no such thing as partial success ([ 6 ][5]). These patterns show that malaria elimination has been a partial success. The possibility that the complete absence of ongoing malaria transmission can become a highly stable state is relevant for policy because it suggests that, before achieving global eradication, some countries could eliminate, scale back control measures, and rely on their health systems. Projected economic costs of elimination are dominated by management of imported malaria ([ 22 ][23], [ 25 ][26]), but if elimination is stable, then it could save costs before achieving eradication. Objections to elimination have been drawn, ironically, from the experiences of countries that did not eliminate. This evidence suggests that elimination on path to eradication may be less risky than currently supposed, and that elimination could have substantial advantages over indefinite control. If malaria elimination helps cause its own stability, then eradication may benefit from regional coordination, but it does not require a globally coordinated campaign. Malaria elimination can proceed like a ratchet, country-by-country and region-by-region culminating in global eradication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More timely estimates of malaria prevalence are needed to inform optimal control strategies and measure progress. Since 2014, Tanzania has implemented nationwide malaria screening for all pregnant women within the antenatal care system. We aimed to compare malaria test results during antenatal care to two population-based prevalence surveys in Tanzanian children aged 6-59 months to examine their potential in measuring malaria trends and progress towards elimination. METHODS: Malaria test results from pregnant women screened at their first antenatal care visits at health-care facilities (private and public) in all 184 districts of Tanzania between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2017, were collected from the Health Management Information Systems and District Health Information System 2. We excluded facilities with no recorded antenatal care attendees during the time period. We standardised results to account for testing uptake and weighted them by the timing of two population-based surveys of childhood malaria prevalence done in 2015-16 (Demographic and Health Survey) and 2017 (Malaria Indicator Survey). We assessed regional-level correlation using Spearman's coefficient and assessed the consistency of monthly district-level prevalence ranking using Kendall's correlation coefficient. FINDINGS: Correlation between malaria prevalence at antenatal care and among children younger than 5 years was high (r\${\textbackslash}geq\$0·83 for both surveys), although declines in prevalence at antenatal care were generally smaller than among children. Consistent heterogeneity (p{\textless}0·05) in antenatal care prevalence at the district level was evident in all but one region (Kilimanjaro). Data from antenatal care showed declining prevalence in three regions (Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara) where surveys estimated zero prevalence. INTERPRETATION: Routine antenatal care-based screening can be used to assess heterogeneity in transmission at finer resolution than population-based surveys, and provides sample sizes powered to detect changes, notably in areas of low transmission where surveys lack power. Declines in prevalence at antenatal care might lag behind those among children, highlighting the value of monitoring burden and continuing prevention efforts among pregnant women as transmission declines. The pregnancy-specific benefits and cost-effectiveness of antenatal care-based screening remain to be assessed. FUNDING: None.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria is rampant in Africa and causes untold mortality and morbidity. Vector-borne diseases are climate sensitive and this has raised considerable concern over the implications of climate change on future disease risk. The problem of malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitoes) shifting from their traditional locations to invade new zones is an important concern. The vision of this study was to exploit the sets of information previously generated by entomologists, e.g. on geographical range of vectors and malaria distribution, to build models that will enable prediction and mapping the potential redistribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in Africa. METHODS: The development of the modelling tool was carried out through calibration of CLIMEX parameters. The model helped estimate the potential geographical distribution and seasonal abundance of the species in relation to climatic factors. These included temperature, rainfall and relative humidity, which characterized the living environment for Anopheles mosquitoes. The same parameters were used in determining the ecoclimatic index (EI). The EI values were exported to a GIS package for special analysis and proper mapping of the potential future distribution of Anopheles gambiae and Anophles arabiensis within the African continent under three climate change scenarios. RESULTS: These results have shown that shifts in these species boundaries southward and eastward of Africa may occur rather than jumps into quite different climatic environments. In the absence of adequate control, these predictions are crucial in understanding the possible future geographical range of the vectors and the disease, which could facilitate planning for various adaptation options. CONCLUSION: Thus, the outputs from this study will be helpful at various levels of decision making, for example, in setting up of an early warning and sustainable strategies for climate change and climate change adaptation for malaria vectors control programmes in Africa.},

Feature selection is an important step in building these models, helping to reduce overfitting and computational complexity, and to improve model interpretability. Selecting features that have a causal relationship with the response variable (not just an association) could potentially improve predictions and generalisability, but identifying these causal features from non-interventional, spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem. Here we apply a causal inference algorithm – the PC algorithm with spatiotemporal prewhitening and nonparametric independence tests – to explore the performance of causal feature selection for predicting malaria incidence in Madagascar. This case study reveals a clear advantage for the causal feature selection approach with respect to the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of forward temporal forecasting, but not for spatiotemporal interpolation, in comparison with no feature selection and LASSO feature selection.},

	abstract = {In mathematical epidemiology, a well-known formula describes the impact of heterogeneity on the basic reproductive number, R0, for situations in which transmission is separable and for which there is one source of variation in susceptibility and one source of variation in infectiousness. This formula is written in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities, as quantified by their coefficients of variation, and the correlation between them. A natural question to ask is whether analogous results apply when there are multiple sources of variation in susceptibility and/or infectiousness. In this paper we demonstrate that with three or more coupled heterogeneities, R0 under separable transmission depends on details of the distribution of the heterogeneities in a way that is not seen in the well-known simpler situation. We provide explicit formulae for the cases of multivariate normal and multivariate log-normal distributions, showing that R0 can again be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities and the pairwise correlations between them. The formulae, however, differ between the two multivariate distributions, demonstrating that no formula of this type applies generally when there are three or more coupled heterogeneities. We see that the results of the formulae are approximately equal when heterogeneities are relatively small and show that an earlier result in the literature (Koella, 1991) should be viewed in this light. We provide numerical illustrations of our results and discuss a setting in which coupled heterogeneities are likely to have a major impact on the value of R0. We also describe a rather surprising result: in a system with three heterogeneities, R0 can exhibit non-monotonic behavior with increasing levels of heterogeneity, in marked contrast to the familiar two heterogeneity setting in which R0 either increases or decreases with increasing heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is influenced by a complex interplay of factors including climate, socio-economic, environmental factors and interventions. Malaria control efforts across Africa have shown a mixed impact. Climate driven factors may play an increasing role with climate change. Efforts to strengthen routine facility-based monthly malaria data collection across Africa create an increasingly valuable data source to interpret burden trends and monitor control programme progress. A better understanding of the association with other climatic and non-climatic drivers of malaria incidence over time and space may help guide and interpret the impact of interventions. METHODS: Routine monthly paediatric outpatient clinical malaria case data were compiled from 27 districts in Malawi between 2004 and 2017, and analysed in combination with data on climatic, environmental, socio-economic and interventional factors and district level population estimates. A spatio-temporal generalized linear mixed model was fitted using Bayesian inference, in order to quantify the strength of association of the various risk factors with district-level variation in clinical malaria rates in Malawi, and visualized using maps. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2017 reported childhood clinical malaria case rates showed a slight increase, from 50 to 53 cases per 1000 population, with considerable variation across the country between climatic zones. Climatic and environmental factors, including average monthly air temperature and rainfall anomalies, normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) and RDT use for diagnosis showed a significant relationship with malaria incidence. Temperature in the current month and in each of the 3 months prior showed a significant relationship with the disease incidence unlike rainfall anomaly which was associated with malaria incidence at only three months prior. Estimated risk maps show relatively high risk along the lake and Shire valley regions of Malawi. CONCLUSION: The modelling approach can identify locations likely to have unusually high or low risk of malaria incidence across Malawi, and distinguishes between contributions to risk that can be explained by measured risk-factors and unexplained residual spatial variation. Also, spatial statistical methods applied to readily available routine data provides an alternative information source that can supplement survey data in policy development and implementation to direct surveillance and intervention efforts.},

	abstract = {Complex exposure histories and immune mediated interactions between influenza strains contribute to the life course of human immunity to influenza. Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8\% of participants, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest variation. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. \#\#\# Funding Statement This study was supported by grants from the NIH R56AG048075 (D.A.T.C., J.L.), NIH R01AI114703 (D.A.T.C., B.Y.), the Wellcome Trust 200861/Z/16/Z (S.R.) and 200187/Z/15/Z (S.R.).

	abstract = {Existing theory on competition for hosts between pathogen strains has proposed that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of strain structure consisting of discrete, weakly overlapping antigenic repertoires. This prediction of strain theory has conceptual overlap with fundamental ideas in ecology on niche partitioning and limiting similarity between coexisting species in an ecosystem, which oppose the hypothesis of neutral coexistence. For Plasmodium falciparum, strain theory has been specifically proposed in relation to the major surface antigen of the blood stage, known as PfEMP1 and encoded by the multicopy multigene family known as the var genes. Deep sampling of the DBLα domain of var genes in the local population of Bakoumba, West Africa, was completed to define whether patterns of repertoire overlap support a role of immune selection under the opposing force of high outcrossing, a characteristic of areas of intense malaria transmission. Using a 454 high-throughput sequencing protocol, we report extremely high diversity of the DBLα domain and a large parasite population with DBLα repertoires structured into nonrandom patterns of overlap. Such population structure, significant for the high diversity of var genes that compose it at a local level, supports the existence of “strains” characterized by distinct var gene repertoires. Nonneutral, frequency-dependent competition would be at play and could underlie these patterns. With a computational experiment that simulates an intervention similar to mass drug administration, we argue that the observed repertoire structure matters for the antigenic var diversity of the parasite population remaining after intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa has a major impact on malaria epidemiology. While much is known about malaria in rural areas in Burkina Faso, the urban situation is less well understood. METHODS: An assessment of urban malaria was carried out in Ouagadougou in November -December, 2002 during which a rapid urban malaria appraisal (RUMA) was applied. RESULTS: The school parasitaemia prevalence was relatively high (48.3\%) at the cold and dry season 2002. Routine malaria statistics indicated that seasonality of malaria transmission was marked. In the health facilities, the number of clinical cases diminished quickly at the start of the cold and dry season and the prevalence of parasitaemia detected in febrile and non-febrile cases was 21.1\% and 22.0\%, respectively. The health facilities were likely to overestimate the malaria incidence and the age-specific fractions of malaria-attributable fevers were low (0-0.13). Peak prevalence tended to occur in older children (aged 6-15 years). Mapping of Anopheles sp. breeding sites indicated a gradient of endemicity between the urban centre and the periphery of Ouagadougou. A remarkable link was found between urban agriculture activities, seasonal availability of water supply and the occurrence of malaria infections in this semi-arid area. The study also demonstrated that the usage of insecticide-treated nets and the education level of family caretakers played a key role in reducing malaria infection rates. CONCLUSION: These findings show that determining local endemicity and the rate of clinical malaria cases are urgently required in order to target control activities and avoid over-treatment with antimalarials. The case management needs to be tailored to the level of the prevailing endemicity.},

	abstract = {Asymptomatic carriage of malaria parasites occurs frequently in endemic areas and the detection of parasites in a blood film from a febrile individual does not necessarily indicate clinical malaria. In areas of low and moderate endemicity the parasite prevalence in fever cases can be compared with that in community controls to estimate the fraction of cases which are attributable to malaria. In areas of very high transmission such estimates of the attributable fraction may be imprecise because very few individuals are without parasites. Furthermore, non-malarial fevers appear to suppress low levels of parasitaemia resulting in biased estimates of the attributable fraction. Alternative estimation techniques were therefore explored using data collected during 1989-1991 from a highly endemic area of Tanzania, where over 80 per cent of young children are parasitaemic. Logistic regression methods which model fever risk as a continuous function of parasite density give more precise estimates than simple analyses of parasite prevalence and overcome problems of bias caused by the effects of non-malarial fevers. Such models can be used to estimate the probability that any individual episode is malaria-attributable and can be extended to allow for covariates. A case definition for symptomatic malaria that is used widely in endemic areas requires fever together with a parasite density above a specific cutoff. The choice of a cutoff value can be assisted by using the probabilities derived from the logistic model to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the case definition.},

These technologies coupled with prevalence/incidence data can provide reliable estimates of population at risk, predict disease distributions in areas that lack baseline data and provide guidance for intervention strategies, so that scarce resources can be allocated in a cost-effective manner. This review focuses on the spatial technology applications that have been used in epidemiology and control of malaria in Africa. Peer-reviewed papers identified through a PubMed search using the following keywords: geospatial technology OR Geographic Information Systems OR Remote Sensing OR Earth Observation OR Global Positioning Systems OR geospatial modelling OR malaria incidence OR malaria prevalence OR malaria risk prediction OR malaria mapping AND malaria AND Africa were used. These included mapping malaria incidence and prevalence, assessing the relationship between malaria and environmental variables as well as applications for malaria early warning systems. The potential of new spatial technology applications utilising emerging satellite information, as they hold promise to further enhance infectious risk mapping and disease prediction, are outlined. We stress current research needs to overcome some of the remaining challenges of spatial technology applications for malaria so that further and sustainable progress can be made to control and eliminate this disease.},

In February 2018, the World Health Organization issued guidance on investigating suspected false-negative rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) due to pfhrp2/3 deletions. However, no guidance is provided regarding the timing of investigations. Failure to consider seasonal variation could cause premature decisions to switch to alternative RDTs. In response, we have extended our methods and predict that the prevalence of false-negative RDTs due to pfhrp2/3 deletions is highest when sampling from younger individuals during the beginning of the rainy season.

	abstract = {Surveillance and diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria relies predominantly on rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). However, false-negative (FN) RDT results are known to occur for a variety of reasons, including operator error, poor storage conditions, pfhrp2/3 gene deletions, poor performance of specific RDT brands and lots, and low-parasite density infections. We used RDT and microscopy results from 85 000 children enrolled in Demographic Health Surveys and Malaria Indicator Surveys from 2009 to 2015 across 19 countries to explore the distribution of and risk factors for FN-RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria's impact is greatest. We sought to (1) identify spatial and demographic patterns of FN-RDT results, defined as a negative RDT but positive gold standard microscopy test, and (2) estimate the percentage of infections missed within community-based malaria surveys due to FN-RDT results. Across all studies, 19.9\% (95\% CI 19.0\% to 20.9\%) of microscopy-positive subjects were negative by RDT. The distribution of FN-RDT results was spatially heterogeneous. The variance in FN-RDT results was best explained by the prevalence of malaria, with an increase in FN-RDT results observed at lower transmission intensities, among younger subjects, and in urban areas. The observed proportion of FN-RDT results was not predicted by differences in RDT brand or lot performance alone. These findings characterise how the probability of detection by RDTs varies in different transmission settings and emphasise the need for careful interpretation of prevalence estimates based on surveys employing RDTs alone. Further studies are needed to characterise the cost-effectiveness of improved malaria diagnostics (eg, PCR or highly sensitive RDTs) in community-based surveys, especially in regions of low transmission intensity or high urbanicity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In malaria endemic populations, complex patterns of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage infection dynamics may be observed. Genotyping samples from longitudinal cohort studies for merozoite surface protein (msp) variants increases the information available in the data, allowing multiple infecting parasite clones in a single individual to be identified. msp genotyped samples from two longitudinal cohorts in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Thailand were analysed using a statistical model where the times of acquisition and clearance of each clone in every individual were estimated using a process of data augmentation. RESULTS: For the populations analysed, the duration of blood-stage P. falciparum infection was estimated as 36 (95\% Credible Interval (CrI): 29, 44) days in PNG, and 135 (95\% CrI 94, 191) days in Thailand. Experiments on simulated data indicated that it was not possible to accurately estimate the duration of blood-stage P. vivax infections due to the lack of identifiability between a single blood-stage infection and multiple, sequential blood-stage infections caused by relapses. Despite this limitation, the method and data point towards short duration of blood-stage P. vivax infection with a lower bound of 24 days in PNG, and 29 days in Thailand. On an individual level, P. vivax recurrences cannot be definitively classified into re-infections, recrudescences or relapses, but a probabilistic relapse phenotype can be assigned to each P. vivax sample, allowing investigation of the association between epidemiological covariates and the incidence of relapses. CONCLUSION: The statistical model developed here provides a useful new tool for in-depth analysis of malaria data from longitudinal cohort studies, and future application to data sets with multi-locus genotyping will allow more detailed investigation of infection dynamics.},

In order for an HDSS to deliver high quality data, effective organization of data collection and management are vital. HDSSs impose a challenging logistical process typically characterized by door to door visits, poor navigational guidance, conducting interviews recorded on paper, error prone data entry, an extensive staff and marginal data quality management possibilities. METHODS: A large trial investigating the effect of odour-baited mosquito traps on malaria vector populations and malaria transmission on Rusinga Island, western Kenya, has deployed an HDSS. By means of computer tablets in combination with Open Data Kit and OpenHDS data collection and management software experiences with time efficiency, cost effectiveness and high data quality are illustrate. Step by step, a complete organization of the data management infrastructure is described, ranging from routine work in the field to the organization of the centralized data server. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Adopting innovative technological advancements has enabled the collection of demographic and malaria data quickly and effectively, with minimal margin for errors. Real-time data quality controls integrated within the system can lead to financial savings and a time efficient work flow.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Capacity strengthening of rural communities, and the various actors that support them, is needed to enable them to lead their own malaria control programmes. Here the existing capacity of a rural community in western Kenya was evaluated in preparation for a larger intervention. METHODS: Focus group discussions and semi-structured individual interviews were carried out in 1,451 households to determine (1) demographics of respondent and household; (2) socio-economic status of the household; (3) knowledge and beliefs about malaria (symptoms, prevention methods, mosquito life cycle); (4) typical practices used for malaria prevention; (5) the treatment-seeking behaviour and household expenditure for malaria treatment; and (6) the willingness to prepare and implement community-based vector control. RESULTS: Malaria was considered a major threat to life but relevant knowledge was a chimera of scientific knowledge and traditional beliefs, which combined with socio-economic circumstances, leads to ineffective malaria prevention. The actual malaria prevention behaviour practiced by community members differed significantly from methods known to the respondents. Beside bednet use, the major interventions implemented were bush clearing and various hygienic measures, even though these are ineffective for malaria prevention. Encouragingly, most respondents believed malaria could be controlled and were willing to contribute to a community-based malaria control program but felt they needed outside assistance. CONCLUSION: Culturally sensitive but evidence-based education interventions, utilizing participatory tools, are urgently required which consider traditional beliefs and enable understanding of causal connections between mosquito ecology, parasite transmission and the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. Community-based organizations and schools need to be equipped with knowledge through partnerships with national and international research and tertiary education institutions so that evidence-based research can be applied at the grassroots level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Field studies are evaluating if mass drug administration (MDA) might shorten the time to elimination of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, when vector control measures and reactive surveillance strategies are scaled-up. A concern with this strategy is that there may be resurgence of transmission following MDA. METHODS: A conceptual model was developed to classify possible outcomes of an initial period of MDA, followed by continuously implementing other interventions. The classification considered whether elimination or a new endemic stable state is achieved, and whether changes are rapid, transient, or gradual. These categories were informed by stability analyses of simple models of vector control, case management, and test-and-treat interventions. Individual-based stochastic models of malaria transmission (OpenMalaria) were then used to estimate the probability and likely rates of resurgence in realistic settings. Effects of concurrent interventions, including routine case management and test-and-treat strategies were investigated. RESULTS: Analysis of the conceptual models suggest resurgence will occur after MDA unless transmission potential is very low, or the post-MDA prevalence falls below a threshold, which depends on both transmission potential and on the induction of bistability. Importation rates are important only when this threshold is very low. In most OpenMalaria simulations the approximately stable state achieved at the end of the simulations was independent of inclusion of MDA and the final state was unaffected by importation of infections at plausible rates. Elimination occurred only with high effective coverage of case management, low initial prevalence, and high intensity test-and-treat. High coverage of case management but not by test-and-treat induced bistability. Where resurgence occurred, its rate depended mainly on transmission potential (not treatment rates). CONCLUSIONS: A short burst of high impact MDA is likely to be followed by resurgence. To avert resurgence, concomitant interventions need either to substantially reduce average transmission potential or to be differentially effective in averting or clearing infections at low prevalence. Case management at high effective coverage has this differential effect, and should suffice to avert resurgence caused by imported cases at plausible rates of importation. Once resurgence occurs, its rate depends mainly on transmission potential, not on treatment strategies.},

Few field studies focus on the primary malaria vector in high to moderate endemic areas, Nyssorhynchus darlingi, as the key entomological component of malaria risk, and on the metrics of Plasmodium vivax propagation in Amazonian rural communities. METHODS: Human landing catch collections were carried out in 36 houses of 26 communities in five municipalities in the Brazilian states of Acre, Amazonas and Rondônia states, with API ({\textgreater} 30). In addition, data on the number of locally acquired symptomatic infections were employed in mathematical modelling analyses carried out to determine Ny. darlingi vector competence and vectorial capacity to P. vivax; and to calculate the basic reproduction number for P. vivax. RESULTS: Entomological indices and malaria metrics ranged among localities: prevalence of P. vivax infection in Ny. darlingi, from 0.243\% in Mâncio Lima, Acre to 3.96\% in Machadinho D'Oeste, Rondônia; daily human-biting rate per person from 23 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.18 in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, to 66 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2.41 in Lábrea, Amazonas; vector competence from 0.00456 in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas to 0.04764 in Mâncio Lima, Acre; vectorial capacity from 0.0836 in Mâncio Lima, to 1.5 in Machadinho D'Oeste. The estimated R0 for P. vivax (PvR0) was 3.3 in Mâncio Lima, 7.0 in Lábrea, 16.8 in Cruzeiro do Sul, 55.5 in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, and 58.7 in Machadinho D'Oeste. Correlation between P. vivax prevalence in Ny. darlingi and vector competence was non-linear whereas association between prevalence of P. vivax in mosquitoes, vectorial capacity and R0 was linear and positive. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of low vector competence of Ny. darlingi to P. vivax, parasite propagation in the human population is enhanced by the high human-biting rate, and relatively high vectorial capacity. The high PvR0 values suggest hyperendemicity in Machadinho D'Oeste and São Gabriel da Cachoeira at levels similar to those found for P. falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa regions. Mass screening for parasite reservoirs, effective anti-malarial drugs and vector control interventions will be necessary to shrinking transmission in Amazonian rural communities, Brazil.},

	abstract = {Relationships between area coverage with insecticide-free bednets and prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum were investigated in 7 community-based surveys over a 33-month period in 1990-93 in 6 villages in the Wosera area of Papua New Guinea. Spatial patterns in circumsporozoite rates for P. falciparum, P. vivax isomorphs K210 and K247, and P. malariae, and the proportions of mosquito blood meals positive for specific human, goat, cat, dog and pig antigens were determined using ELISAs. P. falciparum prevalence in humans was better explained by bednet coverage in the immediate vicinity than by personal protection alone. Circumsporozoite rates for both P. falciparum and P. vivax were also inversely related to coverage with bednets. There was some increase in zoophagy in areas with high coverage, but relatively little effect on the human blood index or on overall mosquito densities. In this setting, protracted use of untreated bednets apparently reduces sporozoite rates, and the associated effects on prevalence are greater than can be accounted for by personal protection. Even at high bednet coverage most anophelines feed on human hosts, so the decreased sporozoite rates are likely to be largely due to reduction of mosquito survival. This finding highlights the importance of local vector ecology for outcomes of bednet programmes and suggests that area effects of untreated bednets should be reassessed in other settings.},

	abstract = {The time it takes for malaria parasites to develop within a mosquito, and become transmissible, is known as the extrinsic incubation period, or EIP. EIP is a key parameter influencing transmission intensity as it combines with mosquito mortality rate and competence to determine the number of mosquitoes that ultimately become infectious. In spite of its epidemiological significance, data on EIP are scant. Current approaches to estimate EIP are largely based on temperature-dependent models developed from data collected on parasite development within a single mosquito species in the 1930s. These models assume that the only factor affecting EIP is mean environmental temperature. Here, we review evidence to suggest that in addition to mean temperature, EIP is likely influenced by genetic diversity of the vector, diversity of the parasite, and variation in a range of biotic and abiotic factors that affect mosquito condition. We further demonstrate that the classic approach of measuring EIP as the time at which mosquitoes first become infectious likely misrepresents EIP for a mosquito population. We argue for a better understanding of EIP to improve models of transmission, refine predictions of the possible impacts of climate change, and determine the potential evolutionary responses of malaria parasites to current and future mosquito control tools.},

	abstract = {Studies of the exophily exhibited by anophelines in a humid coastal area and in an arid inland region of Tanganyika gave very different results. In the former area, catches of A. gambiae were scanty and largely composed of unfed and gravid females, while in the latter, large numbers of mosquitos were caught outside and a great many of them were recently fed females. The differences are attributed primarily to the presence outside of large herds of cattle in the inland region and to their absence near the coast.The reports of exophily from other parts of Africa are also analysed and show that there is much variation in the behaviour of A. gambiae in different regions. Some of the variation can be explained in terms of environmental differences, particularly in the availability at night of different hosts. But some of it may be genetically determined. It is suggested that the main task in this field is twofold: firstly, to establish the existence and nature of the behaviour differences described; secondly, to study in detail the mosquitos that survive as exophilic populations in areas where systematic house-spraying is in operation.},

	title = {A simulation study of disaggregation regression for spatial disease mapping},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03604},
	abstract = {Disaggregation regression has become an important tool in spatial disease mapping for making fine-scale predictions of disease risk from aggregated response data. By including high resolution covariate information and modelling the data generating process on a fine scale, it is hoped that these models can accurately learn the relationships between covariates and response at a fine spatial scale. However, validating these high resolution predictions can be a challenge, as often there is no data observed at this spatial scale. In this study, disaggregation regression was performed on simulated data in various settings and the resulting fine-scale predictions are compared to the simulated ground truth. Performance was investigated with varying numbers of data points, sizes of aggregated areas and levels of model misspecification. The effectiveness of cross validation on the aggregate level as a measure of fine-scale predictive performance was also investigated. Predictive performance improved as the number of observations increased and as the size of the aggregated areas decreased. When the model was well-specified, fine-scale predictions were accurate even with small numbers of observations and large aggregated areas. Under model misspecification predictive performance was significantly worse for large aggregated areas but remained high when response data was aggregated over smaller regions. Cross-validation correlation on the aggregate level was a moderately good predictor of fine-scale predictive performance. While the simulations are unlikely to capture the nuances of real-life response data, this study gives insight into the effectiveness of disaggregation regression in different contexts.},

In Amazonian Peru, the identification of the most productive, positive water bodies would increase the impact of targeted mosquito control on aquatic life stages. The present study explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for identifying Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi) breeding sites with high-resolution imagery ( 0.02m/pixel) and their multispectral profile in Amazonian Peru. Our results show that high-resolution multispectral imagery can discriminate a profile of water bodies where Ny. darlingi is most likely to breed (overall accuracy 86.73\%- 96.98\%) with a moderate differentiation of spectral bands. This work provides proof-of-concept of the use of high-resolution images to detect malaria vector breeding sites in Amazonian Peru and such innovative methodology could be crucial for LSM malaria integrated interventions.},

We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics that generates expected antibody titres over time. Our aim is to provide a flexible package to identify infection histories that can be applied to a range of pathogens.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Housing is essential to human well-being but neglected in global health. Today, housing in Africa is rapidly improving alongside economic development, creating an urgent need to understand how these changes can benefit health. We hypothesised that improved housing is associated with better health in children living in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of housing conditions relative to a range of child health outcomes in SSA. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional data were analysed for 824,694 children surveyed in 54 Demographic and Health Surveys, 21 Malaria Indicator Surveys, and two AIDS Indicator Surveys conducted in 33 countries between 2001 and 2017 that measured malaria infection by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT), diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections (ARIs), stunting, wasting, underweight, or anaemia in children aged 0-5 years. The mean age of children was 2.5 years, and 49.7\% were female. Housing was categorised into a binary variable based on a United Nations definition comparing improved housing (with improved drinking water, improved sanitation, sufficient living area, and finished building materials) versus unimproved housing (all other houses). Associations between house type and child health outcomes were determined using conditional logistic regression within surveys, adjusting for prespecified covariables including age, sex, household wealth, insecticide-treated bed net use, and vaccination status. Individual survey odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Across surveys, improved housing was associated with 8\%-18\% lower odds of all outcomes except ARI (malaria infection by microscopy: adjusted OR [aOR] 0.88, 95\% confidence intervals [CIs] 0.80-0.97, p = 0.01; malaria infection by RDT: aOR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.77-0.88, p {\textless} 0.001; diarrhoea: aOR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.88-0.97, p = 0.001; ARI: aOR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.87-1.07, p = 0.49; stunting: aOR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.77-0.88, p {\textless} 0.001; wasting: aOR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.83-0.99, p = 0.03; underweight: aOR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.80-0.90, p {\textless} 0.001; any anaemia: aOR 0.87, 95\% CI 0.82-0.92, p {\textless} 0.001; severe anaemia: aOR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.84-0.95, p {\textless} 0.001). In comparison, insecticide-treated net use was associated with 16\%-17\% lower odds of malaria infection (microscopy: aOR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.78-0.88, p {\textless} 0.001; RDT: aOR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.79-0.88, p {\textless} 0.001). Drinking water source and sanitation facility alone were not associated with diarrhoea. The main study limitations are the use of self-reported diarrhoea and ARI, as well as potential residual confounding by socioeconomic position, despite adjustments for household wealth and education. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that poor housing, which includes inadequate drinking water and sanitation facility, is associated with health outcomes known to increase child mortality in SSA. Improvements to housing may be protective against a number of important childhood infectious diseases as well as poor growth outcomes, with major potential to improve children's health and survival across SSA.},

The authors developed a GIS system linked to the disease surveillance database at the Baltimore Health Department and used this system to evaluate the geographic epidemiology of gonorrhea in Baltimore, Maryland, during 1994. There were 7,330 reported cases, of which 87.4\% were in persons aged 15-39 years; 56.6\% were of the cases were in males; and 60.5\% of the cases were reported from the nonsexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic sector. Valid residential addresses were available for 6,831 (93.5\%) of cases. In the GIS system, gonorrhea cases were geocoded by reported address using digitized maps, and assigned to census tract. Census tract-specific rates for persons aged 15-39 years were calculated using 1990 census data. Gonorrhea was reported from 196/202 (97\%) of census tracts, of which 90 census tracts had {\textgreater}30 cases. For these 90 census tracts, rates were ranked. The core was considered as the top rate quartile, consisting of 13 geographically contiguous census tracts with rates 4,370-6,370 per 100,000; adjacent areas were 19 census tracts in the second quartile (rates: 3,730-4,370 per 100,000). As radial distance from the core areas increased, incidence rates decreased and male/female ratio increased, which is consistent with previous definitions of the core theory of STD transmission. Mapping of cases by provider showed that cases reported from STD clinics had similar geographic distribution to those from the non-STD clinic sector. From an operational perspective, GIS can be effectively integrated with clinical data systems to provide epidemiologic analysis.},

	abstract = {The history of modelling vector-borne infections essentially begins with the papers by Ross on malaria. His models assume that the dynamics of malaria can most simply be characterized by two equations that describe the prevalence of malaria in the human and mosquito hosts. This structure has formed the central core of models for malaria and most other vector-borne diseases for the past century, with additions acknowledging important aetiological details. We partially add to this tradition by describing a malaria model that provides for vital dynamics in the vector and the possibility of super-infection in the human host: reinfection of asymptomatic hosts before they have cleared a prior infection. These key features of malaria aetiology create the potential for break points in the prevalence of infected hosts, sudden transitions that seem to characterize malaria's response to control in different locations. We show that this potential for critical transitions is a general and underappreciated feature of any model for vector-borne diseases with incomplete immunity, including the canonical Ross-McDonald model. Ignoring these details of the host's immune response to infection can potentially lead to serious misunderstanding in the interpretation of malaria distribution patterns and the design of control schemes for other vector-borne diseases.

	abstract = {Summary Background Substantial reductions in malaria have been reported in several African countries after distribution of insecticide-treated bednets and the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). Our aim was to assess the effect of these policies on malaria morbidity, mosquito populations, and asymptomatic infections in a west African rural population. Methods We did a longitudinal study of inhabitants of Dielmo village, Senegal, between January, 2007, and December, 2010. We monitored the inhabitants for fever during this period and we treated malaria attacks with artesunate plus amodiaquine. In July, 2008, we offered longlasting insecticide (deltamethrin)-treated nets (LLINs) to all villagers. We did monthly night collections of mosquitoes during the whole study period, and we assessed asymptomatic carriage from cross-sectional surveys. Our statistical analyses were by negative binomial regression, logistic regression, and binomial or Fisher exact test. Findings There were 464 clinical malaria attacks attributable to Plasmodium falciparum during 17 858 person-months of follow-up. The incidence density of malaria attacks averaged 5·45 (95\% CI 4·90–6·05) per 100 person-months between January, 2007, and July, 2008, before the distribution of LLINs. Incidence density decreased to 0·41 (0·29–0·55) between August, 2008, and August, 2010, but increased back to 4·57 (3·54–5·82) between September and December, 2010—ie, 27–30 months after the distribution of LLINs. The rebound of malaria attacks were highest in adults and children aged 10 years or older: 45 (63\%) of 71 malaria attacks recorded in 2010 compared with 126 (33\%) of 384 in 2007 and 2008 (p{\textless}0·0001). 37\% of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were resistant to deltamethrin in 2010, and the prevalence of the Leu1014Phe kdr resistance mutation increased from 8\% in 2007 to 48\% in 2010 (p=0·0009). Interpretation Increasing pyrethroid resistance of A gambiae and increasing susceptibility of older children and adults, probably due to decreasing immunity, caused the rebound and age shift of malaria morbidity. Strategies to address the problem of insecticide resistance and to mitigate its effects must be urgently defined and implemented.

However, little is known about the burden caused by these two malaria species. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We did a longitudinal study of the inhabitants of Dielmo village, Senegal, between June, 1990, and December, 2010. We monitored the inhabitants for fever during this period and performed quarterly measurements of parasitemia. We analyzed parasitological and clinical data in a random-effect logistic regression model to investigate the relationship between the level of parasitemia and the risk of fever and to establish diagnostic criteria for P. ovale and P. malariae clinical attacks. The prevalence of P. ovale and P. malariae infections in asymptomatic individuals were high during the first years of the project but decreased after 2004 and almost disappeared in 2010 in relation to changes in malaria control policies. The average incidence densities of P. ovale and P. malariae clinical attacks were 0.053 and 0.093 attacks per person per year in children {\textless}15 years and 0.024 and 0.009 attacks per person per year in adults \${\textbackslash}geq\$ 15 years, respectively. These two malaria species represented together 5.9\% of the malaria burden. CONCLUSIONS: P. ovale and P. malariae were a common cause of morbidity in Dielmo villagers until the recent dramatic decrease of malaria that followed the introduction of new malaria control policies. P. ovale and P. malariae may constitute an important cause of morbidity in many areas of tropical Africa.},

	abstract = {A longitudinal study of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in infants in Idete village, south-eastern Tanzania, was conducted over a period of 14 months in order to determine the incidence of P. falciparum infection and clinical malaria in the first year of life. Of 1356 blood slides from cross-sectional surveys, 52.1\% were positive for asexual stages of P. falciparum. There were marked increases in P. falciparum prevalence, parasite densities, overall fever incidence and the incidence of malaria fevers with age for the first 6 months of life. The average attack rate, estimated from a reversible catalytic model, was 0.029 per day with a slight increase with age but there was no initial period of protection against infection in neonates. Estimated average duration of infections was 64 days, with infections in older infants lasting much longer than those contracted during the first 2 months of life. These results support the hypotheses that the main effect of passively transferred maternal immunity to malaria is in the control of asexual stage parasites, and that the level of clinical immunity depends upon the extent of recent exposure to parasites. Infants as young as 4 months of age are at high risk of clinical attacks. Intervention programmes against malaria in areas of the highest transmission should therefore be designed to include this group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of malaria in well-defined cohorts offer important data about the epidemiology of this complex disease, but few have been done in urban African populations. To generate a sampling frame for a longitudinal study of malaria incidence and treatment in Kampala, Uganda, a census, mapping and survey project was conducted. METHODS: All households in a geographically defined area were enumerated and mapped. Probability sampling was used to recruit a representative sample of children and collect baseline descriptive data for future longitudinal studies. RESULTS: 16,172 residents living in 4931 households in a densely-populated community (18,824 persons/km2) were enumerated. A total of 582 households were approached with at least one child less than 10 years of age in order to recruit 601 children living in 322 households. At enrollment, 19\% were parasitaemic, 24\% were anaemic, 43\% used bednets, and 6\% used insecticide-treated nets. Low G6PD activity (OR = 0.33, P = 0.009) and bednet use (OR = 0.64, P = 0.045) were associated with a decreased risk of parasitaemia. Increasing age (OR = 0.62 for each year, P {\textless} 0.001) and bednet use (OR = 0.58, P = 0.02) were associated with a decreased risk of anaemia CONCLUSION: Detailed surveys of target populations in urban Africa can provide valuable descriptive data and provide a sampling frame for recruitment of representative cohorts for longitudinal studies. Plans to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve the understanding of the distribution and determinants of malaria incidence and response to therapy in this population are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efforts to quantify the global burden of enteric fever are valuable for understanding the health lost and the large-scale spatial distribution of the disease. We present the estimates of typhoid and paratyphoid fever burden from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, and the approach taken to produce them. METHODS: For this systematic analysis we broke down the relative contributions of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers by country, year, and age, and analysed trends in incidence and mortality. We modelled the combined incidence of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers and split these total cases proportionally between typhoid and paratyphoid fevers using aetiological proportion models. We estimated deaths using vital registration data for countries with sufficiently high data completeness and using a natural history approach for other locations. We also estimated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. FINDINGS: Globally, 14·3 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 12·5-16·3) cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers occurred in 2017, a 44·6\% (42·2-47·0) decline from 25·9 million (22·0-29·9) in 1990. Age-standardised incidence rates declined by 54·9\% (53·4-56·5), from 439·2 (376·7-507·7) per 100 000 person-years in 1990, to 197·8 (172·0-226·2) per 100 000 person-years in 2017. In 2017, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi caused 76·3\% (71·8-80·5) of cases of enteric fever. We estimated a global case fatality of 0·95\% (0·54-1·53) in 2017, with higher case fatality estimates among children and older adults, and among those living in lower-income countries. We therefore estimated 135·9 thousand (76·9-218·9) deaths from typhoid and paratyphoid fever globally in 2017, a 41·0\% (33·6-48·3) decline from 230·5 thousand (131·2-372·6) in 1990. Overall, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers were responsible for 9·8 million (5·6-15·8) DALYs in 2017, down 43·0\% (35·5-50·6) from 17·2 million (9·9-27·8) DALYs in 1990. INTERPRETATION: Despite notable progress, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers remain major causes of disability and death, with billions of people likely to be exposed to the pathogens. Although improvements in water and sanitation remain essential, increased vaccine use (including with typhoid conjugate vaccines that are effective in infants and young children and protective for longer periods) and improved data and surveillance to inform vaccine rollout are likely to drive the greatest improvements in the global burden of the disease.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has emerged in Southeast Asia and now poses a threat to the control and elimination of malaria. Mapping the geographic extent of resistance is essential for planning containment and elimination strategies. METHODS: Between May 2011 and April 2013, we enrolled 1241 adults and children with acute, uncomplicated falciparum malaria in an open-label trial at 15 sites in 10 countries (7 in Asia and 3 in Africa). Patients received artesunate, administered orally at a daily dose of either 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 4 mg per kilogram, for 3 days, followed by a standard 3-day course of artemisinin-based combination therapy. Parasite counts in peripheral-blood samples were measured every 6 hours, and the parasite clearance half-lives were determined. RESULTS: The median parasite clearance half-lives ranged from 1.9 hours in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 7.0 hours at the Thailand-Cambodia border. Slowly clearing infections (parasite clearance half-life {\textgreater}5 hours), strongly associated with single point mutations in the “propeller” region of the P. falciparum kelch protein gene on chromosome 13 (kelch13), were detected throughout mainland Southeast Asia from southern Vietnam to central Myanmar. The incidence of pretreatment and post-treatment gametocytemia was higher among patients with slow parasite clearance, suggesting greater potential for transmission. In western Cambodia, where artemisinin-based combination therapies are failing, the 6-day course of antimalarial therapy was associated with a cure rate of 97.7\% (95\% confidence interval, 90.9 to 99.4) at 42 days. CONCLUSIONS: Artemisinin resistance to P. falciparum, which is now prevalent across mainland Southeast Asia, is associated with mutations in kelch13. Prolonged courses of artemisinin-based combination therapies are currently efficacious in areas where standard 3-day treatments are failing.

	abstract = {Five schools were chosen in different districts of Brazzaville where the intensity of malaria transmission, determined in a previous study, is representative of the very varied conditions observed in this town in relation to urbanization. The parasitological and serological results found in schoolchildren are analysed according to the level of transmission to which they are exposed, and compared with the results of a longitudinal survey carried out in the rural area of the Brazzaville region. In the urban area malaria prevalences in schoolchildren aged from 5 to 9 years and from 10 to 14 years vary considerably according to the districts. They are, respectively, 78.9\% and 84\% in Massina, 58.8\% and 71.7\% in Talangai, 32.3\% and 46.9\% in Bacongo and 5.6\% and 12.6\% in Moungali. In Poto-Poto, no positive thick films were found in a representative sample of 62 schoolchildren aged 6 and 7 years who have always lived in this district, and the malaria prevalence is only 6.9\% in schoolchildren aged 14 and 15. In the rural area, the malaria prevalence is 76.4\% in schoolchildren aged 5 to 9 and 82\% in those aged from 10 to 14. According to standard immunofluorescent technique, 63\% of children aged 6 and 7 years living since birth in the central part of the Poto-Poto and Moungali districts have no detectable antibodies. In the rural area, all children over 4 years of age are seropositive. These results show that the decrease in vectorial density which accompanies urbanization has considerable parasitological repercussions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, there has been remarkable progress in malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa, due mainly to the massive deployment of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. Despite these gains, it is clear that in many situations, additional interventions are needed to further reduce malaria transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has promoted the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) approach through its Global Vector Control Response 2017-2030. However, prior roll-out of larval source management (LSM) as part of IVM, knowledge on ecology of larval aquatic habitats is required. METHODS: Aquatic habitats colonized by immature Anopheles and culicines vectors were characterized at three sites of low, medium and high malaria transmission in Uganda from October 2011 to June 2015. Larval surveys were conducted along transects in each site and aquatic habitats described according to type and size. Immature Anopheles, culicines and pupae from the described habitats were sampled using standard dipping methods to determine larval and pupae densities. Larvae were identified as anopheline or culicine, and counted. Pupae were not identified further. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the presence of immature Anopheles and culicines in each site. RESULTS: A total of 1205 larval aquatic habitats were surveyed and yielded a total of 17,028 anopheline larvae, 26,958 culicine larvae and 1189 pupae. Peaks in larval abundance occurred in all sites in March-May and August-October coinciding with the rainy seasons. Anopheles larvae were found in 52.4\% (n = 251) of aquatic habitats in Tororo, a site of high transmission, 41.9\% (n = 536) of habitats in Kanungu, a site with moderate malaria transmission, and 15.8\% (n = 418) in Jinja, a site with low malaria transmission. The odds of finding larvae was highest in rice fields compared to pools in both Tororo (odds ratio, OR = 4.21, 95\% CI 1.22-14.56, p = 0.02) and Kanungu (OR = 2.14, 95\% CI 1.12-4.07, p = 0.02), while in Jinja the odd were highest in containers (OR = 4.55, 95\% CI = 1.09-19.14, p = 0.03). In Kanungu, larvae were less likely to be found in containers compared to pools (OR = 0.26, 95\% CI 0.09-0.66, p = 0.008) and river fringe (OR = 0.19, 95\% CI 0.07-0.52, p = 0.001). Medium sized habitats were associated with high odds of finding larvae compared to small habitats (OR = 3.59, 95\% CI 1.18-14.19, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that immature Anopheles and culicines were common in areas of high and moderate transmission but were rare in areas of low transmission. Although immature Anopheles and culicines were found in all types of water bodies, they were most common in rice fields and less common in open drains and in river fringes. Methods are needed to reduce the aquatic stages of anopheline mosquitoes in human-made habitats, particularly rice fields.},

Even for the same disease, different authors use different model formulations, but a study of the dynamical consequences of assuming different hypotheses is missing. In this work we present different formulations of the basic Ross-Macdonald model together with a careful discussion of the assumptions behind each model. The most general model presented is an agent based model for which arbitrary distributions for latency and infectious periods for both, host and vectors, is considered. At population level we also developed a deterministic Volterra integral equations model for which also arbitrary distributions in the waiting times are included. We compare the model solutions using different distributions for the infectious and latency periods using statistics, like the epidemic peak, or epidemic final size, to characterize the epidemic curves. The basic reproduction number (R0) for each formulation is computed and compared with empirical estimations obtained with the agent based models. The importance of considering realistic distributions for the latent and infectious periods is highlighted and discussed. We also show that seasonality is a key driver of vector-borne disease dynamics shaping the epidemic curve and its duration.},

One such method, trace-driven memory simulation, has been the subject of intense interest among researchers and has, as a result, enjoyed rapid development and substantial improvements during the past decade. This article surveys and analyzes these developments by establishing criteria for evaluating trace-driven methods, and then applies these criteria to describe, categorize, and compare over 50 trace-driven simulation tools. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and show that no single method is best when all criteria, including accuracy, speed, memory, flexibility, portability, expense, and ease of use are considered. In a concluding section, we examine fundamental limitations to trace-driven simulation, and survey some recent developments in memory simulation that may overcome these bottlenecks.},

	abstract = {Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is an established model in clinical malaria research. Upon exposure to Plasmodium falciparum parasites, malaria-naive volunteers differ in dynamics and composition of their immune profiles and subsequent capacity to generate protective immunity. CHMI volunteers are either inflammatory responders who have prominent cellular IFN-γ production primarily driven by adaptive T cells, or tempered responders who skew toward antibody-mediated humoral immunity. When exposed to consecutive CHMIs under antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, individuals who can control parasitemia after a single immunization (fast responders) are more likely to be protected against a subsequent challenge infection. Fast responders tend to be inflammatory responders who can rapidly induce long-lived IFN-γ+ T cell responses. Slow responders or even non-responders can also be protected, but via a more diverse range of responses that take a longer time to reach full protective efficacy, in part due to their tempered phenotype. The latter group can be identified at baseline before CHMI by higher expression of inhibitory ligands CTLA-4 and TIM-3 on CD4+ T cells. Delineating heterogeneity in human immune responses to P. falciparum will facilitate rational design and strategy towards effective malaria vaccines.},

A recent reanalysis of laboratory experiments indicates that absolute humidity strongly modulates the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus. Here, we extend these findings to the human population level, showing that the onset of increased wintertime influenza-related mortality in the United States is associated with anomalously low absolute humidity levels during the prior weeks. We then use an epidemiological model, in which observed absolute humidity conditions temper influenza transmission rates, to successfully simulate the seasonal cycle of observed influenza-related mortality. The model results indicate that direct modulation of influenza transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is sufficient to produce this observed seasonality. These findings provide epidemiological support for the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal variations of influenza transmission in temperate regions.},

	abstract = {Influenza A incidence peaks during winter in temperate regions. The basis for this pronounced seasonality is not understood, nor is it well documented how influenza A transmission principally occurs. Previous studies indicate that relative humidity (RH) affects both influenza virus transmission (IVT) and influenza virus survival (IVS). Here, we reanalyze these data to explore the effects of absolute humidity on IVT and IVS. We find that absolute humidity (AH) constrains both transmission efficiency and IVS much more significantly than RH. In the studies presented, 50\% of IVT variability and 90\% of IVS variability are explained by AH, whereas, respectively, only 12\% and 36\% are explained by RH. In temperate regions, both outdoor and indoor AH possess a strong seasonal cycle that minimizes in winter. This seasonal cycle is consistent with a wintertime increase in IVS and IVT and may explain the seasonality of influenza. Thus, differences in AH provide a single, coherent, more physically sound explanation for the observed variability of IVS, IVT and influenza seasonality in temperate regions. This hypothesis can be further tested through future, additional laboratory, epidemiological and modeling studies.},

	title = {Mapping malaria seasonality in {Madagascar} using health facility data},
	volume = {18},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many malaria-endemic areas experience seasonal fluctuations in case incidence as Anopheles mosquito and Plasmodium parasite life cycles respond to changing environmental conditions. Identifying location-specific seasonality characteristics is useful for planning interventions. While most existing maps of malaria seasonality use fixed thresholds of rainfall, temperature, and/or vegetation indices to identify suitable transmission months, we construct a statistical modelling framework for characterising the seasonal patterns derived directly from monthly health facility data. METHODS: With data from 2669 of the 3247 health facilities in Madagascar, a spatiotemporal regression model was used to estimate seasonal patterns across the island. In the absence of catchment population estimates or the ability to aggregate to the district level, this focused on the monthly proportions of total annual cases by health facility level. The model was informed by dynamic environmental covariates known to directly influence seasonal malaria trends. To identify operationally relevant characteristics such as the transmission start months and associated uncertainty measures, an algorithm was developed and applied to model realisations. A seasonality index was used to incorporate burden information from household prevalence surveys and summarise 'how seasonal' locations are relative to their surroundings. RESULTS: Positive associations were detected between monthly case proportions and temporally lagged covariates of rainfall and temperature suitability. Consistent with the existing literature, model estimates indicate that while most parts of Madagascar experience peaks in malaria transmission near March-April, the eastern coast experiences an earlier peak around February. Transmission was estimated to start in southeast districts before southwest districts, suggesting that indoor residual spraying should be completed in the same order. In regions where the data suggested conflicting seasonal signals or two transmission seasons, estimates of seasonal features had larger deviations and therefore less certainty. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly health facility data can be used to establish seasonal patterns in malaria burden and augment the information provided by household prevalence surveys. The proposed modelling framework allows for evidence-based and cohesive inferences on location-specific seasonal characteristics. As health surveillance systems continue to improve, it is hoped that more of such data will be available to improve our understanding and planning of intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to outdoor and residual transmission and insecticide resistance, long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) will be insufficient as stand-alone malaria vector control interventions in many settings as programmes shift toward malaria elimination. Combining additional vector control interventions as part of an integrated strategy would potentially overcome these challenges. Larval source management (LSM) and structural house improvements (HI) are appealing as additional components of an integrated vector management plan because of their long histories of use, evidence on effectiveness in appropriate settings, and unique modes of action compared to LLINs and IRS. Implementation of LSM and HI through a community-based approach could provide a path for rolling-out these interventions sustainably and on a large scale. METHODS/DESIGN: We will implement community-based LSM and HI, as additional interventions to the current national malaria control strategies, using a randomised block, 2 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 2 factorial, cluster-randomised design in rural, southern Malawi. These interventions will be continued for two years. The trial catchment area covers about 25,000 people living in 65 villages. Community participation is encouraged by training community volunteers as health animators, and supporting the organisation of village-level committees in collaboration with The Hunger Project, a non-governmental organisation. Household-level cross-sectional surveys, including parasitological and entomological sampling, will be conducted on a rolling, 2-monthly schedule to measure outcomes over two years (2016 to 2018). Coverage of LSM and HI will also be assessed throughout the trial area. DISCUSSION: Combining LSM and/or HI together with the interventions currently implemented by the Malawi National Malaria Control Programme is anticipated to reduce malaria transmission below the level reached by current interventions alone. Implementation of LSM and HI through a community-based approach provides an opportunity for optimum adaptation to the local ecological and social setting, and enhances the potential for sustainability.

Two functional forms of eggs oviposition rate, namely the Verhulst-Pearl logistic and Maynard-Smith-Slatkin functions, are used. Rigorous analysis of the autonomous version of the model shows that, for any of the oviposition functions considered, the trivial equilibrium of the model is locally- and globally-asymptotically stable if a certain vectorial threshold quantity is less than unity. Conditions for the existence and global asymptotic stability of the non-trivial equilibrium solutions of the model are also derived. The model is shown to undergo a Hopf bifurcation under certain conditions (and that increased density-dependent competition in larval mortality reduces the likelihood of such bifurcation). The analyses reveal that the Maynard-Smith-Slatkin oviposition function sustains more oscillations than the Verhulst-Pearl logistic function (hence, it is more suited, from ecological viewpoint, for modeling the egg oviposition process). The non-autonomous model is shown to have a globally-asymptotically stable trivial periodic solution, for each of the oviposition functions, when the associated reproduction threshold is less than unity. Furthermore, this model, in the absence of density-dependent mortality rate for larvae, has a unique and globally-asymptotically stable periodic solution under certain conditions. Numerical simulations of the non-autonomous model, using mosquito surveillance and weather data from the Peel region of Ontario, Canada, show a peak mosquito abundance for temperature and rainfall values in the range [Formula: see text]C and [15-35] mm, respectively. These ranges are recorded in the Peel region between July and August (hence, this study suggests that anti-mosquito control effects should be intensified during this period).},

In this work the biology of Aedes aegypti is incorporated into the framework of a stochastic population dynamics model able to handle seasonal and total extinction as well as endemic situations. The model incorporates explicitly the dependence with temperature. The ecological parameters of the model are tuned to the present populations of Aedes aegypti in Buenos Aires city, which is at the border of the present day geographical distribution in South America. Temperature thresholds for the mosquito survival are computed as a function of average yearly temperature and seasonal variation as well as breeding site availability. The stochastic analysis suggests that the southern limit of Aedes aegypti distribution in South America is close to the 15 degrees C average yearly isotherm, which accounts for the historical and current distribution better than the traditional criterion of the winter (July) 10 degrees C isotherm.},

A particularly large outbreak occurred on Réunion Island in 2006, the published data from which forms the basis of the current study. A simple, deterministic mathematical model of the transmission of the virus between humans and mosquitoes was constructed and parameterised with the up-to-date literature on infection biology. The model is fitted to the large Réunion epidemic, resulting in an estimate of 4.1 for the type reproduction number of chikungunya. Although simplistic, the model provided a close approximation of both the peak incidence of the outbreak and the final epidemic size. Sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated the strong influence that both the latent period of infection in humans and the pre-patent period have on these two epidemiological outcomes. We show why separating these variables, which are epidemiologically distinct in chikungunya infections, is not only necessary for accurate model fitting but also important in informing control.},

It is a proven vector of dengue and chikungunya viruses, with the potential to host a further 24 arboviruses. It has recently expanded its geographical range, threatening many countries in the Middle East, Mediterranean, Europe and North America. Here, we investigate the theoretical limitations of its range expansion by developing an environmentally-driven mathematical model of its population dynamics. We focus on the temperate strain of Ae. albopictus and compile a comprehensive literature-based database of physiological parameters. As a novel approach, we link its population dynamics to globally-available environmental datasets by performing inference on all parameters. We adopt a Bayesian approach using experimental data as prior knowledge and the surveillance dataset of Emilia-Romagna, Italy, as evidence. The model accounts for temperature, precipitation, human population density and photoperiod as the main environmental drivers, and, in addition, incorporates the mechanism of diapause and a simple breeding site model. The model demonstrates high predictive skill over the reference region and beyond, confirming most of the current reports of vector presence in Europe. One of the main hypotheses derived from the model is the survival of Ae. albopictus populations through harsh winter conditions. The model, constrained by the environmental datasets, requires that either diapausing eggs or adult vectors have increased cold resistance. The model also suggests that temperature and photoperiod control diapause initiation and termination differentially. We demonstrate that it is possible to account for unobserved properties and constraints, such as differences between laboratory and field conditions, to derive reliable inferences on the environmental dependence of Ae. albopictus populations.},

The findings illustrate that spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue are predictable from the local vector dynamics, which in turn, can be predicted by climate conditions. On the basis of the similar epidemiology and transmission cycles, we believe that this integrated approach and the finer mosquito surveillance data provide a framework that can be extended to predict outbreak risk of other mosquito-borne diseases as well as project dengue risk maps for future climate scenarios.},

Through a rigorous analysis via theories and methods of dynamical systems, we prove that the global behavior of the model depends strongly on two biological insightful quantities : the vector reproduction ratio Rv and the basic reproduction ratio R0. Indeed, if Rv1 and R01 and R0{\textgreater}1 the disease remains persistent.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is weather dependent arboviral infection of livestock and humans. Population dynamics of mosquito vectors is associated with disease epidemics. In our study, we use daily temperature and rainfall as model inputs to simulate dynamics of mosquito vectors population in relation to disease epidemics. METHODS/FINDINGS: Time-varying distributed delays (TVDD) and multi-way functional response equations were implemented to simulate mosquito vectors and hosts developmental stages and to establish interactions between stages and phases of mosquito vectors in relation to vertebrate hosts for infection introduction in compartmental phases. An open-source modelling platforms, Universal Simulator and Qt integrated development environment were used to develop models in C++ programming language. Developed models include source codes for mosquito fecundity, host fecundity, water level, mosquito infection, host infection, interactions, and egg time. Extensible Markup Language (XML) files were used as recipes to integrate source codes in Qt creator with Universal Simulator plug-in. We observed that Floodwater Aedines and Culicine population continued to fluctuate with temperature and water level over simulation period while controlled by availability of host for blood feeding. Infection in the system was introduced by floodwater Aedines. Culicines pick infection from infected host once to amplify disease epidemic. Simulated mosquito population show sudden unusual increase between December 1997 and January 1998 a similar period when RVF outbreak occurred in Ngorongoro district. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Findings presented here provide new opportunities for weather-driven RVF epidemic simulation modelling. This is an ideal approach for understanding disease transmission dynamics towards epidemics prediction, prevention and control. This approach can be used as an alternative source for generation of calibrated RVF epidemics data in different settings.},

	abstract = {Rift Valley Fever is a vector-borne disease mainly transmitted by mosquito. To gain some quantitative insights into its dynamics, a deterministic model with mosquito, livestock, and human host is formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and analyzed. The disease threshold [Formula: see text] is computed and used to investigate the local stability of the equilibria. A sensitivity analysis is performed and the most sensitive model parameters to the measure of initial disease transmission [Formula: see text] and the endemic equilibrium are determined. Both [Formula: see text] and the disease prevalence in mosquitoes are more sensitive to the natural mosquito death rate, d(m). The disease prevalence in livestock and humans are more sensitive to livestock and human recruitment rates, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, suggesting isolation of livestock from humans is a viable preventive strategy during an outbreak. Numerical simulations support the analytical results in further exploring theoretically the long-term dynamics of the disease at the population level.},

	abstract = {The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the principal vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses, is an anthropophilic species adapted to urban environments, particularly to housing. A decisive factor in the proliferation of this species is ambient temperature, which has a direct influence on the vital rates of the species. Here we present a structured matrix population model for analyzing the effect of temperature on the population dynamics of Aedes aegypti. The model is structured following the four natural stages of the species: egg, larva, pupa and adult. A set of population projection matrices (one for each temperature between 5 and 30°C), was constructed and parameterized using published data on the biology of the species. The output of the models showed that pupation does not occur at temperatures below 8°C. The population's growth rate was calculated for temperatures between 11 and 30°C, resulting in an increasing function showing that temperatures above 12°C are sufficient for population growth. For each matrix, a sensitivity and elasticity analysis of the parameters was performed. Together with the results from the population stable distribution analysis, they suggest that policies aimed at reducing the abundance of Aedes aegypti should seek to lower the survival probability in the egg and larval stages. The population dynamics was simulated under different seasonal scenarios. This seasonal analysis allows asserting that the egg stage dominates the population dynamics at all seasons.},

Over the next two decades, consensus climate predictions make it possible to produce forecasts for a number of important infectious diseases that are largely independent of the uncertainty of longer-term emissions scenarios. In particular, the role of climate in the modulation of seasonal disease transmission needs to be unravelled from the complex dynamics resulting from the interaction of transmission with herd immunity and intervention measures that depend upon previous burdens of infection. Progress is also needed to solve the mismatch between climate projections and disease projections at the scale of public health interventions. In the time horizon of seasons to years, early warning systems should benefit from current developments on multi-model ensemble climate prediction systems, particularly in areas where high skill levels of climate models coincide with regions where large epidemics take place. A better understanding of the role of climate extremes on infectious diseases is urgently needed.},

Dynamical systems theory has provided useful tools to understand the nature of these changes. When certain non-linearities underlie system dynamics, rapid transitions may happen when critical thresholds for certain parameter values are overcome. Here we describe a malaria dynamical model that couples vector and human disease dynamics through mosquito infectious bites, with the possibility of super-infection, this is, the reinfection of asymptomatic hosts before they have cleared a prior infection. This key feature creates the potential for sudden transitions in the prevalence of infected hosts that seem to characterize malaria's response to environmental conditions. This dynamic behavior may challenge control strategies in different locations. We argue that the potential for critical transitions is a general and overlooked feature of any model for vector borne diseases with incomplete, complex immunity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Substantial progress has been made in reducing the burden of malaria in Africa since 2000, but those gains could be jeopardised if the COVID-19 pandemic affects the availability of key malaria control interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate plausible effects on malaria incidence and mortality under different levels of disruption to malaria control. METHODS: Using an established set of spatiotemporal Bayesian geostatistical models, we generated geospatial estimates across malaria-endemic African countries of the clinical case incidence and mortality of malaria, incorporating an updated database of parasite rate surveys, insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage, and effective treatment rates. We established a baseline estimate for the anticipated malaria burden in Africa in the absence of COVID-19-related disruptions, and repeated the analysis for nine hypothetical scenarios in which effective treatment with an antimalarial drug and distribution of ITNs (both through routine channels and mass campaigns) were reduced to varying extents. FINDINGS: We estimated 215·2 (95\% uncertainty interval 143·7-311·6) million cases and 386·4 (307·8-497·8) thousand deaths across malaria-endemic African countries in 2020 in our baseline scenario of undisrupted intervention coverage. With greater reductions in access to effective antimalarial drug treatment, our model predicted increasing numbers of cases and deaths: 224·1 (148·7-326·8) million cases and 487·9 (385·3-634·6) thousand deaths with a 25\% reduction in antimalarial drug coverage; 233·1 (153·7-342·5) million cases and 597·4 (468·0-784·4) thousand deaths with a 50\% reduction; and 242·3 (158·7-358·8) million cases and 715·2 (556·4-947·9) thousand deaths with a 75\% reduction. Halting planned 2020 ITN mass distribution campaigns and reducing routine ITN distributions by 25\%-75\% also increased malaria burden to a total of 230·5 (151·6-343·3) million cases and 411·7 (322·8-545·5) thousand deaths with a 25\% reduction; 232·8 (152·3-345·9) million cases and 415·5 (324·3-549·4) thousand deaths with a 50\% reduction; and 234·0 (152·9-348·4) million cases and 417·6 (325·5-553·1) thousand deaths with a 75\% reduction. When ITN coverage and antimalarial drug coverage were synchronously reduced, malaria burden increased to 240·5 (156·5-358·2) million cases and 520·9 (404·1-691·9) thousand deaths with a 25\% reduction; 251·0 (162·2-377·0) million cases and 640·2 (492·0-856·7) thousand deaths with a 50\% reduction; and 261·6 (167·7-396·8) million cases and 768·6 (586·1-1038·7) thousand deaths with a 75\% reduction. INTERPRETATION: Under pessimistic scenarios, COVID-19-related disruption to malaria control in Africa could almost double malaria mortality in 2020, and potentially lead to even greater increases in subsequent years. To avoid a reversal of two decades of progress against malaria, averting this public health disaster must remain an integrated priority alongside the response to COVID-19.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is currently complementing techniques to age-grade mosquitoes. NIRS classifies lab-reared and semi-field raised mosquitoes into {\textless} or \${\textbackslash}geq\$ 7 days old with an average accuracy of 80\%, achieved by training a regression model using partial least squares (PLS) and interpreted as a binary classifier. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We explore whether using an artificial neural network (ANN) analysis instead of PLS regression improves the current accuracy of NIRS models for age-grading malaria transmitting mosquitoes. We also explore if directly training a binary classifier instead of training a regression model and interpreting it as a binary classifier improves the accuracy. A total of 786 and 870 NIR spectra collected from laboratory reared An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, respectively, were used and pre-processed according to previously published protocols. The ANN regression model scored root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.6 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.2 for An. gambiae and 2.8 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.2 for An. arabiensis; whereas the PLS regression model scored RMSE of 3.7 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.2 for An. gambiae, and 4.5 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.1 for An. arabiensis. When we interpreted regression models as binary classifiers, the accuracy of the ANN regression model was 93.7 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.0\% for An. gambiae, and 90.2 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.7\% for An. arabiensis; while PLS regression model scored the accuracy of 83.9 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2.3\% for An. gambiae, and 80.3 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2.1\% for An. arabiensis. We also find that a directly trained binary classifier yields higher age estimation accuracy than a regression model interpreted as a binary classifier. A directly trained ANN binary classifier scored an accuracy of 99.4 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.0 for An. gambiae and 99.0 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.6\% for An. arabiensis; while a directly trained PLS binary classifier scored 93.6 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.2\% for An. gambiae and 88.7 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.1\% for An. arabiensis. We further tested the reproducibility of these results on different independent mosquito datasets. ANNs scored higher estimation accuracies than when the same age models are trained using PLS. Regardless of the model architecture, directly trained binary classifiers scored higher accuracies on classifying age of mosquitoes than regression models translated as binary classifiers. CONCLUSION: We recommend training models to estimate age of An. arabiensis and An. gambiae using ANN model architectures (especially for datasets with at least 70 mosquitoes per age group) and direct training of binary classifier instead of training a regression model and interpreting it as a binary classifier.},

	abstract = {Understanding, predicting, and controlling outbreaks of waterborne diseases are crucial goals of public health policies, but pose challenging problems because infection patterns are influenced by spatial structure and temporal asynchrony. Although explicit spatial modeling is made possible by widespread data mapping of hydrology, transportation infrastructure, population distribution, and sanitation, the precise condition under which a waterborne disease epidemic can start in a spatially explicit setting is still lacking. Here we show that the requirement that all the local reproduction numbers R0 be larger than unity is neither necessary nor sufficient for outbreaks to occur when local settlements are connected by networks of primary and secondary infection mechanisms. To determine onset conditions, we derive general analytical expressions for a reproduction matrix G0, explicitly accounting for spatial distributions of human settlements and pathogen transmission via hydrological and human mobility networks. At disease onset, a generalized reproduction number Λ0 (the dominant eigenvalue of G0) must be larger than unity. We also show that geographical outbreak patterns in complex environments are linked to the dominant eigenvector and to spectral properties of G0. Tests against data and computations for the 2010 Haiti and 2000 KwaZulu-Natal cholera outbreaks, as well as against computations for metapopulation networks, demonstrate that eigenvectors of G0 provide a synthetic and effective tool for predicting the disease course in space and time. Networked connectivity models, describing the interplay between hydrology, epidemiology, and social behavior sustaining human mobility, thus prove to be key tools for emergency management of waterborne infections.},

Immunogenicity data have been obtained for P25 in humans that showed significant transmission blocking activity and further advances in formulation should boost this activity. The completion of the malaria genome and ongoing proteomics identified further candidate antigens now entering development.

How P. falciparum bridges two transmission seasons months apart, without being cleared by the human host or compromising host survival, is poorly understood. Here we show that low levels of P. falciparum parasites persist in the blood of asymptomatic Malian individuals during the 5- to 6-month dry season, rarely causing symptoms and minimally affecting the host immune response. Parasites isolated during the dry season are transcriptionally distinct from those of individuals with febrile malaria in the transmission season, coinciding with longer circulation within each replicative cycle of parasitized erythrocytes without adhering to the vascular endothelium. Low parasite levels during the dry season are not due to impaired replication but rather to increased splenic clearance of longer-circulating infected erythrocytes, which likely maintain parasitemias below clinical and immunological radar. We propose that P. falciparum virulence in areas of seasonal malaria transmission is regulated so that the parasite decreases its endothelial binding capacity, allowing increased splenic clearance and enabling several months of subclinical parasite persistence.},

This review and synthesis describes how the effects of thermal variation-in both time and space-can be estimated by applying a simple, nonlinear averaging scheme. The method is first applied to the temporal variation experienced by an individual, providing an estimate of the individual's average performance. The method is then applied to the scale-dependent thermal variation among individuals, which is modelled as a 1/f-noise phenomenon. For an individual, thermal variation reduces average performance, lowers the temperature of maximum performance (Topt ) and contracts the range of viable temperatures. Thermal variation among individuals similarly reduces performance and lowers Topt , but increases the viable range of average temperatures. These results must be viewed with caution, however, because they do not take into account the time-dependent interaction between body temperature and physiological plasticity. Quantifying these interactions is perhaps the largest challenge for ecological and conservation physiologists as they attempt to predict the effects of climate change.},

We explored the extent of diversity of some of the less studied merozoite surface antigens and analyzed the degree of complexity of malaria field isolates by deriving nucleotide sequences of several antigens. We have determined the genotype of apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) in a group of 30 field samples, collected over 29 months, from individuals living in an area of intense malaria transmission in Irian Jaya, identifying 14 different alleles. AMA1 genotyping was combined with previously determined MSP2 typing. AMA1 had the greatest power in distinguishing between isolates but methodological problems, especially when mixed infections are present, suggest it is not an ideal typing target. MSP1, MSP3, and glutamate-rich protein genotypes were also determined from a smaller group of samples, and all results were combined to derive an extended antigenic haplotype. Within this subset of 10 patients, nine different genotypes could be discerned; however, five patients were all infected with the same strain. This strain was present in individuals from two separate villages and was still present 12 months later. This strain was predominant at the first time point but had disappeared at the fourth time point. This significant change in malaria genotypes could be due to strain-specific immunity developing in this population.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance in malarial parasites has become a major obstacle in the control of the disease. Strategies are urgently needed to control the development of resistance and to possibly reverse existing resistance. One key element required to reverse malaria drug resistance is for the parasites to “pay” a biological “cost” or suffer a loss of fitness when acquiring resistance to antimalarial drugs. Such a situation would be a disadvantage to the resistant parasites in the absence of drug pressure. We compared here the relative fitness of atovaquone-resistant Plasmodium falciparum K1 clones with single and double base mutations in their cytochrome b genes to their parent clones during erythrocytic stages in the absence of drug pressure. We found that the double amino acid mutation (M133I and G280D) is associated with a 5 to 9\% loss of fitness and that the single amino acid change of M133I did not result in any detectable loss of fitness. Molecular modeling of the interaction of P. falciparum cytochrome b with ubiquinone led to the prediction that a loss of fitness of the malaria parasites would result from the G280D mutation due to its close proximity to the putative ubiquinone-binding site. This appears to have resulted in a weakening of the cytochrome b-ubiquinone complex, thereby causing the electron transport chain to become less efficient. Our results suggest that the prevalence of resistant parasites may decrease after the drug usage is discontinued.},

The effect of AMA1 allelic diversity on the ability of a recombinant AMA1 vaccine to protect against human infection by different P. falciparum strains is unknown. We characterize two allelic forms of AMA1 that were both produced in Pichia pastoris at a sufficient economy of scale to be usable for clinical vaccine studies. Both proteins were used to immunize rabbits, singly and in combination, in order to evaluate their immunogenicity and the ability of elicited antibodies to block the growth of different P. falciparum clones. Both antigens, when used alone, elicited high homologous anti-AMA1 titers, with reduced strain cross-reactivity. Similarly, sera from rabbits immunized with a single antigen were capable of blocking the growth of homologous parasite strains at levels theoretically sufficient to clear parasite infections. However, heterologous inhibition was significantly reduced, providing experimental evidence that AMA1 allelic diversity is a result of immune pressure. Encouragingly, rabbits immunized with a combination of both antigens exhibited titers and levels of parasite inhibition as good as those of the single-antigen-immunized rabbits for each of the homologous parasite lines, and consequently exhibited a broadening of allelic diversity coverage.},

Transmission-reducing activity (TRA) of human serum can be determined as a percentage, using the Standard Membrane Feeding Assay (SMFA). This laboratory assay was evaluated using the results of 121 experiments with malaria-endemic sera among which many repeated measurements were obtained. The assay consists of the feeding of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes with cultured Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, mixed with human red blood cells, and control and experimental sera. The TRA of individual sera was determined by the comparison of oocyst densities between these sera. Bootstrap data on oocyst densities in individual mosquitoes in control feeds were used to construct confidence limits for TRA percentages of serum feeds. Low (90\%) values for individual sera were usually reproduced in a second experiment, whereas this was more difficult for values between 20\% and 90\%. The observed variability of TRA values is explained in part by the variability in oocyst density per mosquito. Oocyst densities in control feeds varied more between experiments than within experiments and showed a slight decline over the 3 years of experiments. Reproducibility of TRA of field sera was low (20\%) between experiments, but much higher (61 \%) within experiments. A minimum of 35 oocysts per mosquito in control feeds gave optimal reproducibility (44\%) between experiments. We recommend that (1) sera are compared within an experiment, or (2) assays are only analysed where controls have at least 35 oocysts per mosquito. The SMFA is under the recommended conditions appropriate for the study of factors that may influence TRA, e.g. transmission blocking vaccines.},

Two commonly monitored metrics of transmission intensity are parasite prevalence (PR) and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). Using geostatistical methods, we investigate the relationship between Plasmodium falciparum PR and EIR using data collected over 38 months in a rural area of Malawi. Our results indicate that hotspots identified through the EIR and PR partly overlapped during high transmission seasons but not during low transmission seasons. The estimated relationship showed a one-month delayed effect of EIR on PR such that at low transmission levels increases in EIR are associated with rapid rise in PR, but at high transmission levels, decreases in EIR do not translate into notable reductions in PR. Our study emphasises the need for integrated malaria control strategies that combines vector and human host managements monitored by both entomological and parasitaemia indices.},

	abstract = {Given the crucial role of climate in malaria transmission, many mechanistic models of malaria represent vector biology and the parasite lifecycle as functions of climate variables in order to accurately capture malaria transmission dynamics. Lower dimension mechanistic models that utilize implicit vector dynamics have relied on indirect climate modulation of transmission processes, which compromises investigation of the ecological role played by climate in malaria transmission. In this study, we develop an implicit process-based malaria model with direct climate-mediated modulation of transmission pressure borne through the Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR). The EIR, a measure of the number of infectious bites per person per unit time, includes the effects of vector dynamics, resulting from mosquito development, survivorship, feeding activity and parasite development, all of which are moderated by climate. We combine this EIR-model framework, which is driven by rainfall and temperature, with Bayesian inference methods, and evaluate the model's ability to simulate local transmission across 42 regions in Rwanda over four years. Our findings indicate that the biologically-motivated, EIR-model framework is capable of accurately simulating seasonal malaria dynamics and capturing of some of the inter-annual variation in malaria incidence. However, the model unsurprisingly failed to reproduce large declines in malaria transmission during 2018 and 2019 due to elevated anti-malaria measures, which were not accounted for in the model structure. The climate-driven transmission model also captured regional variation in malaria incidence across Rwanda's diverse climate, while identifying key entomological and epidemiological parameters important to seasonal malaria dynamics. In general, this new model construct advances the capabilities of implicitly-forced lower dimension dynamical malaria models by leveraging climate drivers of malaria ecology and transmission.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zanzibar has maintained malaria prevalence below 1\% for the past decade, yet elimination remains elusive despite high coverage of core vector control interventions. As part of a study investigating the magnitude and drivers of residual transmission in Zanzibar, qualitative methods were utilized to better understand night time activities and sleeping patterns, individual and community-level risk perceptions, and malaria prevention practices. METHODS: A total of 62 in-depth interviews were conducted with community members and local leaders across six sites on Unguja Island, Zanzibar. Twenty semi-structured community observations of night-time activities and special events were conducted to complement interview findings. Data were transcribed verbatim, coded, and analysed using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Participants reported high levels of ITN use, but noted gaps in protection, particularly when outdoors or away from home. Routine household and community activities were common in evenings before bed and early mornings, while livelihood activities and special events lasted all or most of the night. Gender variation was reported, with men routinely spending more time away from home than women and children. Outdoor sleeping was reported during special events, such as weddings, funerals, and religious ceremonies. Participants described having difficulty preventing mosquito bites while outdoors, travelling, or away from home, and perceived higher risk of malaria infection during these times. Travel and migration emerged as a crucial issue and participants viewed seasonal workers coming from mainland Tanzania as more likely to have a malaria infection and less likely to be connected to prevention and treatment services in Zanzibar. Some community leaders reported taking the initiative to register seasonal workers coming into their community and linking them to testing and treatment services. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting malaria interventions effectively is critical and should be informed by a clear understanding of relevant human behaviour. These findings highlight malaria prevention gaps in Zanzibar, and the importance of identifying new approaches to complement current interventions and accelerate the final phases of malaria elimination. Development and deployment of complementary interventions should consider human behaviour, including gender norms, that can influence exposure to malaria vectors and prevention practices. Expansion of community-level programmes targeting travellers and seasonal workers should also be explored.},

We validate and demonstrate this method for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, an invasive species and the primary vector of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. We test two contrasting metrics to approximate genetic distance and find Cavalli-Sforza-Edwards distance (CSE) performs better than linearized FST The correlation (R) between the model's predicted genetic distance and actual distance is 0.83.

We examine the distribution of malaria genetics across seven sites within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and two nearby countries, Ghana and Kenya, in order to understand how the relatedness of malaria parasites varies across space, and whether there are barriers to the flow of malaria parasites within the DRC or across borders. Parasite DNA was retrieved from dried blood spots from 7 Demographic and Health Survey sample clusters in the DRC. Malaria genetic characteristics of parasites from Ghana and Kenya were also obtained. For each of 9 geographic sites (7 DRC, 1 Ghana and 1 Kenya), a pair-wise RST statistic was calculated, indicating the genetic distance between malaria parasites found in those locations. Mapping genetics across the spatial extent of the study area indicates a complex genetic landscape, where relatedness between two proximal sites may be relatively high (RST {\textgreater} 0.64) or low (RST {\textless} 0.05), and where distal sites also exhibit both high and low genetic similarity. Mantel's tests suggest that malaria genetics differ as geographic distances increase. Principal Coordinate Analysis suggests that genetically related samples are not co-located. Barrier analysis reveals no significant barriers to gene flow between locations. Malaria genetics in the DRC have a complex and fragmented landscape. Limited exchange of genes across space is reflected in greater genetic distance between malaria parasites isolated at greater geographic distances. There is, however, evidence for close genetic ties between distally located sample locations, indicating that movement of malaria parasites and flow of genes is being driven by factors other than distance decay. This research demonstrates the contributions that spatial disease ecology and landscape genetics can make to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background: Vector control is a vital tool utilised by malaria control and elimination programmes worldwide, and as such it is important that we can accurately quantify the expected public health impact of a range of vector control methods. There are very few previous models that consider vector control induced changes in the age-structure of the vector population and the resulting impact this will have on transmission.Methods: The steady-state solution of a novel age-structured deterministic compartmental model describing the mosquito gonotrophic cycle is analytically derived, with the age of each mosquito measured in the number of gonotrophic cycles (or successful blood meals) completed. From this model we derive analytical expressions for key transmission measures, such as the effective reproductive ratio under control, Rc, and investigate the impact of commonly used vector control methods on the age-structure of the vector population.Results: We derive and analyse a novel model with an explicit solution that can be used to directly quantify key transmission statistics and investigate the age-structured impact of vector control. Application of this model confirms current knowledge that adult-acting interventions, such as IRS or LLINs, are highly effective at reducing transmission, particularly in comparison to larvicide usage at the same coverage. We also find that scaling up coverage results in a wider gap in transmission reduction between adult-active and larval-based interventions. For LLINs and IRS the effective reproductive ratio under control, Rc, decreases exponentially with coverage, whereas for larvicides the relationship is linear. We also find that mid-ranges of LLIN coverage see the largest effect of reduced net integrity on transmission.Conclusions: Well-maintained, adult-acting vector control measures are substantially more effective than larval-based action at reducing the transmission potential of the mosquito population, particularly at medium to high coverage levels.},

This study investigated the relationship between asymptomatic P. falciparum carriage and subsequent clinical malaria episodes in Dielmo and Ndiop villages in Senegal. METHODS: The study used a total of 2,792 venous and capillary blood samples obtained from asymptomatic individuals and clinical malaria datasets collected from 2013 to 2016. Mapping, spatial clustering of infections and risk analysis were performed using georeferenced households. RESULTS: High incidences of clinical malaria episodes were observed to occur predominantly in households of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers. A statistically significant association was found between asymptomatic carriage in a household and subsequent episode of clinical malaria occurring in that household for each individual year (p-values were 0.0017, 6x10 -5, 0.005, and 0.008 for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 respectively) and the combined years (p=8.5x10 -8), which was not found at the individual level. In both villages, no significant patterns of spatial clustering of P. falciparum clinical cases was found, but there was a higher risk of clinical episodes {\textless}25m from asymptomatic individuals in Ndiop attributable to clustering within households. CONCLUSION: The findings provide strong epidemiological evidence linking the asymptomatic P. falciparum reservoir to clinical malaria episodes at household scale in Dielmo and Ndiop villagers.

	abstract = {Recent decades of malaria control have been dominated by extensive commoditisation of frontline interventions. Bed nets, insecticides, drugs and diagnostics have been scaled up in endemic countries, preventing millions of malaria cases and deaths. Unfortunately after years of progress, such gains are stagnating or diminishing due to challenges, such as insecticide and drug resistance, sub-optimal user compliance and the high costs for supply and replacements of these commodities. Without any viable vaccines or approaches that effectively tackle the environmental basis of malaria transmission, current commodities, and in particular the insecticide-based interventions, are incapable of preventing reinfections and rebounds, especially in low-income communities. This paper discusses a transitional approach for malaria prevention, involving judicious use of current tools while gradually building long-term resilience to sustain control of important vectors. The idea should be to carefully transition from insecticide-based to non-insecticidal approaches, without losing the gains made so far against malaria. In the short and medium-term, countries may deploy evidence-driven suites of current tools, e.g. insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), while gradually introducing improved versions, such as nets with multiple chemical ingredients and long-lasting IRS formulations to suppress transmission. Depending on local evidence, these may be supplemented with niche technologies, such as spatial repellents, endectocides, odour-baited traps or mosquitocidal sugar baits to address gaps such as outdoor-biting and pyrethroid resistance. Once this is in place, countries should establish programmes to build long-term resilience to sustain the accrued gains and prevent transmission rebounds. Examples may include: incentivising the private sector to supply high-quality commodities e.g. locally-manufactured mosquito nets, providing subsidies to promote mosquito-free dwellings for low-income families, expanding community engagement in disease control and strengthening health systems to more effectively detect and manage cases. To secure these developments, endemic countries should also establish multi-sectorial initiatives prioritising disease control beyond malaria. Examples may include environmental sanitation to reduce vectors, institutionalised health education and capacity-building on biology and control of disease, appropriate legislation to improve compliance and protect vulnerable sub-populations and longterm domestic financing for malaria control. These programmes should be supported by a strong in-country research culture to constantly identify gaps, monitor progress and seek transformative approaches with potential to accelerate progress. If integrated in the wider public health context, this phased approach could contain ongoing malaria transmission, reduce over-reliance on insecticide-based tools and minimise transmission rebounds even in poor communities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evaluation of genetic relatedness of malaria parasites is a useful tool for understanding transmission patterns, but patterns are not easily detectable in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission. To evaluate the feasibility of detecting genetic relatedness in a moderate malaria transmission setting, relatedness of Plasmodium falciparum infections was measured in cohort participants from randomly selected households in the Kihihi sub-county of Uganda (annual entomological inoculation rate of 27 infectious bites per person). METHODS: All infections detected via microscopy or Plasmodium-specific loop mediated isothermal amplification from passive and active case detection during August 2011-March 2012 were genotyped at 26 microsatellite loci, providing data for 349 samples from 230 participants living in 80 households. Pairwise genetic relatedness was calculated using identity by state (IBS). RESULTS: As expected, genetic diversity was high (mean heterozygosity [He] = 0.73), and the majority (76.5 \%) of samples were polyclonal. Despite the high genetic diversity, fine-scale population structure was detectable, with significant spatiotemporal clustering of highly related infections. Although the difference in malaria incidence between households at higher (mean 1127 metres) versus lower elevation (mean 1015 metres) was modest (1.4 malaria cases per person-year vs. 1.9 per person-year, respectively), there was a significant difference in multiplicity of infection (2.2 vs. 2.6, p = 0.008) and, more strikingly, a higher proportion of highly related infections within households (6.3 \% vs. 0.9 \%, p = 0.0005) at higher elevation compared to lower elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic data from a relatively small number of diverse, multiallelic loci reflected fine scale patterns of malaria transmission. Given the increasing interest in applying genetic data to augment malaria surveillance, this study provides evidence that genetic data can be used to inform transmission patterns at local spatial scales even in moderate transmission areas.},

However, key questions remain surrounding their contribution to sustaining transmission and whether they need to be detected and targeted to achieve malaria elimination. In this study we analyse a range of malaria datasets to quantify the density, detectability, course of infection and infectiousness of subpatent infections. Asymptomatically infected individuals have lower parasite densities on average in low transmission settings compared to individuals in higher transmission settings. In cohort studies, subpatent infections are found to be predictive of future periods of patent infection and in membrane feeding studies, individuals infected with subpatent asexual parasite densities are found to be approximately a third as infectious to mosquitoes as individuals with patent (asexual parasite) infection. These results indicate that subpatent infections contribute to the infectious reservoir, may be long lasting, and require more sensitive diagnostics to detect them in lower transmission settings.},

Environmental management programs were typically implemented as “all-out” campaigns by treating all potential breeding habitats. In contrast, targeted environmental management is based on a sound understanding of the heterogeneity in mosquito productivity. However, deficiencies in field methodology for measuring productivity hamper our progress in understanding of mosquito productivity. To address these issues, we develop a framework of habitat-based interventions by adoption of a landscape approach to elucidate mechanisms underlying mosquito productivity. The importance of vigorously quantitative estimation of the productivity is highlighted. Spatial models are proposed to examine the interrelationship between mosquito productivity and oviposition of gravid mosquitoes. In our view, environmental management approaches must take into account variability in productivity, in efforts to improve feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of such approaches, particularly when implemented along with other malaria control measures.},

Because little is known about the potential for most African mosquito species to transmit RVF virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus, RVFV), we conducted studies to determine the vector competence of selected African species of mosquitoes for this virus. All eight species tested [Aedes palpalis (Newstead), Aedes mcintoshi Huang, Aedes circumluteolus (Theobald), Aedes calceatus Edwards, Aedes aegypti (L.), Culex antennatus (Becker), Culex pipiens (L.), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say], were susceptible to infection, and all except Ae. calceatus, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus transmitted RVFV by bite after oral exposure. Estimated transmission rates for mosquitoes that successfully transmitted RVFV by bite ranged from 5\% for Ae. mcintoshi to 39\% for Ae. palpalis for mosquitoes that fed on a hamster with a viremia {\textgreater} or = 10(8) plaque-forming units of virus/ml. We did not recover RVFV from any of 3,138 progeny of infected female mosquitoes. RVFV is unusual among arboviruses in that it has been isolated in nature from a large number of species and that numerous mosquitoes and other arthropods are able to transmit this virus in the laboratory. The recent introduction and spread of West Nile virus into the Americas and the spread of RVFV to the Arabian Peninsula illustrates the potential for viruses, once enzootic in Africa, to spread to other parts of the world.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ecological theory predicts a diverse range of functional responses of species to resource availability; but in the context of human blood consumption by disease vectors, a simplistic, linear response is ubiquitously assumed. A simple and flexible model formulation is presented that extends the Holling's Types to account for a wider range of qualitatively distinct behaviours, and used to examine the impact of different vector responses to the relative availability of multiple blood-host species. RESULTS: Epidemiological models of falciparum malaria, Chagas disease and Lyme disease demonstrate that the standard, often implicit, assumption of a linear functional response can lead to spurious under- or over-estimates in disease transmission potential, across a full range of pathogen life-cycles. It is shown how the functional response in vector biting can augment disease intervention outcomes. Interactions between vector biting behaviour and uneven pathogen transmission probabilities between alternative hosts, as is the case for Chagas disease, can render infection more resilient to control. CONCLUSIONS: Both the novel response formula and the nested vector-borne disease structure offer a flexible framework that can be applied to other vector-borne diseases in assessing the role of this newly identified aspect of biting behavioural ecology.},

	abstract = {Background Zanzibar provides a good case study for malaria elimination. The islands have experienced a dramatic reduction in malaria burden since the introduction of effective vector control interventions and case management. Malaria prevalence has now been maintained below 1\% for the past decade and the islands can feasibly aim for elimination. Methods To better understand factors that may contribute to remaining low-level malaria transmission in Zanzibar, layered human behavioural and entomological research was conducted between December 2016 and December 2017 in 135 randomly selected households across six administrative wards. The study included: (1) household surveys, (2) structured household observations of nighttime activity and sleeping patterns, and (3) paired indoor and outdoor mosquito collections. Entomological and human behavioural data were integrated to provide weighted estimates of exposure to vector bites, accounting for proportions of people indoors or outdoors, and protected by insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) each hour of the night. Results Overall, 92\% of female Anopheles mosquitoes were caught in the rainy season compared to 8\% in the dry season and 72\% were caught outdoors compared to 28\% indoors. For individual ITN users, ITNs prevented an estimated two-thirds (66\%) of exposure to vector bites and nearly three quarters (73\%) of residual exposure was estimated to occur outdoors. Based on observed levels of ITN use in the study sites, the population-wide mean personal protection provided by ITNs was 42\%. Discussion/conclusions This study identified gaps in malaria prevention in Zanzibar with results directly applicable for improving ongoing programme activities. While overall biting risk was low, the most notable finding was that current levels of ITN use are estimated to prevent less than half of exposure to malaria vector bites. Variation in ITN use across sites and seasons suggests that additional gains could be made through targeted social and behaviour change interventions. However, even for ITN users, gaps in protection remain, with a majority of exposure to vector bites occurring outdoors before going to sleep. Supplemental interventions targeting outdoor exposure to malaria vectors, and groups that may be at increased risk of exposure to malaria vectors, should be explored.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approaches in malaria risk mapping continue to advance in scope with the advent of geostatistical techniques spanning both the spatial and temporal domains. A substantive review of the merits of the methods and covariates used to map malaria risk has not been undertaken. Therefore, this review aimed to systematically retrieve, summarise methods and examine covariates that have been used for mapping malaria risk in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). METHODS: A systematic search of malaria risk mapping studies was conducted using PubMed, EBSCOhost, Web of Science and Scopus databases. The search was restricted to refereed studies published in English from January 1968 to April 2020. To ensure completeness, a manual search through the reference lists of selected studies was also undertaken. Two independent reviewers completed each of the review phases namely: identification of relevant studies based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, data extraction and methodological quality assessment using a validated scoring criterion. RESULTS: One hundred and seven studies met the inclusion criteria. The median quality score across studies was 12/16 (range: 7-16). Approximately half (44\%) of the studies employed variable selection techniques prior to mapping with rainfall and temperature selected in over 50\% of the studies. Malaria incidence (47\%) and prevalence (35\%) were the most commonly mapped outcomes, with Bayesian geostatistical models often (31\%) the preferred approach to risk mapping. Additionally, 29\% of the studies employed various spatial clustering methods to explore the geographical variation of malaria patterns, with Kulldorf scan statistic being the most common. Model validation was specified in 53 (50\%) studies, with partitioning data into training and validation sets being the common approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our review highlights the methodological diversity prominent in malaria risk mapping across SSA. To ensure reproducibility and quality science, best practices and transparent approaches should be adopted when selecting the statistical framework and covariates for malaria risk mapping. Findings underscore the need to periodically assess methods and covariates used in malaria risk mapping; to accommodate changes in data availability, data quality and innovation in statistical methodology.},

	abstract = {The temporal fluctuation of water levels and the presence of mosquito larvae were investigated for four types of small container habitats (treeholes, bamboo stumps, cemetery stone vases, and cemetery stone vessels) on Kabeshima Island in Kyushu, southwestern Japan. The probability that containers held water was positively correlated with the quantity of the preceding rainfall and with the depth and volume of the containers. It was estimated that dehydration occurred more regularly in autumn and winter than in summer. The probability that mosquito larvae were present in each type of container was positively correlated with habitat stability in terms of the probability of the existence of standing water and the coefficient of variation of the water level. Twelve species of mosquito larvae, including two rare predators, were found. Species composition differed between the different types of container. Although 4 to 10 species used each type of container, the median number of species per container was two for treeholes and bamboo stumps, and one for the others. The dominant species wasTripteroides bambusa in treeholes and bamboo stumps,Aedes albopictus in stone vases, andA. japonicus in stone vessels. The larval mosquito community, which lacked major predators, possessed the following features that may facilitate the coexistence of many species: (1) niche segregation amongst species in terms of their selection of container types; (2) an aggregated distribution of the individual species among containers of the same type; (3) high intraspecific mean crowding (and hence probably intense intraspecific competition) in the dominant species in each type of container; (4) independent species associations within the same type of container; and (5) low interspecific mean crowding (and hence probablynot intense interspecific competition) between species in the same type of container.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The foraging behavior of blood-sucking arthropods is the defining biological event shaping the transmission cycle of vector-borne parasites. It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns. METHODS \& RESULTS: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases. DISCUSSION: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.},

Such information is further integrated with the senses of temperature and humidity, as well as vision, processed in the brain into a behavioral output, leading to host finding.

Greenwood, Marsh and Snow(1) and Marsh(2) have discussed the hypothesis that the severity of malaria depends on the size of the inoculum, that is, on the number of sporozoites inoculated at one time(3). According to these authors, this is suggested by the results of vector control trials in which parasite prevalence remained the same but episodes of disease were reduced. This is clearly an important observation, but Jo Lines and Jo Armstrong interpret it differently. They see the primary implication of these results as being that natural immunity to malaria must be largely strain specific, and only if there is strain specificity can inoculum size be important.

How daily rhythms shape, and are shaped by, interactions between organisms is poorly understood. Here, we review an emerging area, namely the causes and consequences of daily rhythms in the interactions between vectors, their hosts and the parasites they transmit. We focus on mosquitoes, malaria parasites and vertebrate hosts, because this system offers the opportunity to integrate from genetic and molecular mechanisms to population dynamics and because disrupting rhythms offers a novel avenue for disease control.},

	abstract = {Global environmental change is expected to affect profoundly the transmission of the parasites that cause human malaria. Amongst the anthropogenic drivers of change, deforestation is arguably the most conspicuous, and its rate is projected to increase in the coming decades. The canonical epidemiological understanding is that deforestation increases malaria risk in Africa and the Americas and diminishes it in South-east Asia. Partial support for this position is provided here, through a systematic review of the published literature on deforestation, malaria and the relevant vector bionomics. By using recently updated boundaries for the spatial limits of malaria and remotely-sensed estimates of tree cover, it has been possible to determine the population at risk of malaria in closed forest, at least for those malaria-endemic countries that lie within the main blocks of tropical forest. Closed forests within areas of malaria risk cover approximately 1.5 million km2 in the Amazon region, 1.4 million km2 in Central Africa, 1.2 million km2 in the Western Pacific, and 0.7 million km2 in South-east Asia. The corresponding human populations at risk of malaria within these forests total 11.7 million, 18.7 million, 35.1 million and 70.1 million, respectively. By coupling these numbers with the country-specific rates of deforestation, it has been possible to rank malaria-endemic countries according to their potential for change in the population at risk of malaria, as the result of deforestation. The on-going research aimed at evaluating these relationships more quantitatively, through the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP), is highlighted.},

	abstract = {Despite the critical role that contact between hosts and vectors, through vector bites, plays in driving vector-borne disease (VBD) transmission, transmission risk is primarily studied through the lens of vector density and overlooks host-vector contact dynamics. This review article synthesizes current knowledge of host-vector contact with an emphasis on mosquito bites. It provides a framework including biological and mathematical definitions of host-mosquito contact rate, blood-feeding rate, and per capita biting rates. We describe how contact rates vary and how this variation is influenced by mosquito and vertebrate factors. Our framework challenges a classic assumption that mosquitoes bite at a fixed rate determined by the duration of their gonotrophic cycle. We explore alternative ecological assumptions based on the functional response, blood index, forage ratio, and ideal free distribution within a mechanistic host-vector contact model. We highlight that host-vector contact is a critical parameter that integrates many factors driving disease transmission. A renewed focus on contact dynamics between hosts and vectors will contribute new insights into the mechanisms behind VBD spread and emergence that are sorely lacking. Given the framework for including contact rates as an explicit component of mathematical models of VBD, as well as different methods to study contact rates empirically to move the field forward, researchers should explicitly test contact rate models with empirical studies. Such integrative studies promise to enhance understanding of extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting host-vector contact rates and thus are critical to understand both the mechanisms driving VBD emergence and guiding their prevention and control.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the first part of this study, an extensive literature survey led to the construction of a new version of the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM). A new set of parameter settings was provided and a new development of the mathematical formulation of important processes related to the vector population was performed within the LMM. In this part of the study, so far undetermined model parameters are calibrated through the use of data from field studies. The latter are also used to validate the new LMM version, which is furthermore compared against the original LMM version. METHODS: For the calibration and validation of the LMM, numerous entomological and parasitological field observations were gathered for West Africa. Continuous and quality-controlled temperature and precipitation time series were constructed using intermittent raw data from 34 weather stations across West Africa. The meteorological time series served as the LMM data input. The skill of LMM simulations was tested for 830 different sets of parameter settings of the undetermined LMM parameters. The model version with the highest skill score in terms of entomological malaria variables was taken as the final setting of the new LMM version. RESULTS: Validation of the new LMM version in West Africa revealed that the simulations compare well with entomological field observations. The new version reproduces realistic transmission rates and simulated malaria seasons are comparable to field observations. Overall the new model version performs much better than the original model. The new model version enables the detection of the epidemic malaria potential at fringes of endemic areas and, more importantly, it is now applicable to the vast area of malaria endemicity in the humid African tropics. CONCLUSIONS: A review of entomological and parasitological data from West Africa enabled the construction of a new LMM version. This model version represents a significant step forward in the modelling of a weather-driven malaria transmission cycle. The LMM is now more suitable for the use in malaria early warning systems as well as for malaria projections based on climate change scenarios, both in epidemic and endemic malaria areas.},

	abstract = {Malaria is a major public health problem in West Africa. Previous studies have shown that climate variability significantly affects malaria transmission. The lack of continuous observed weather station data and the absence of surveillance data for malaria over long periods have led to the use of reanalysis data to drive malaria models. In this study, we use the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM) to simulate spatiotemporal variability of malaria in West Africa using daily rainfall and temperature from the following: Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20th CR), National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis of the Twentieth Century (ERA20C), and interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). Malaria case data from the national surveillance program in Senegal are used for model validation between 2001 and 2016. The warm temperatures found over the Sahelian fringe of West Africa can lead to high malaria transmission during wet years. The rainfall season peaks in July to September over West Africa and Senegal, and the malaria season lasts from September to November, about 1-2 months after the rainfall peak. The long-term trends exhibit interannual and decadal variabilities. The LMM shows acceptable performance in simulating the spatial distribution of malaria incidence. However, some discrepancies are found. These results are useful for decision-makers who plan public health and control measures in affected West African countries. The study would have substantial implications for directing malaria surveillance activities and health policy. In addition, this malaria modeling framework could lead to the development of an early warning system for malaria in West Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A warm and humid climate triggers several water-associated diseases such as malaria. Climate- or weather-driven malaria models, therefore, allow for a better understanding of malaria transmission dynamics. The Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM) is a mathematical-biological model of malaria parasite dynamics using daily temperature and precipitation data. In this study, the parameter settings of the LMM are refined and a new mathematical formulation of key processes related to the growth and size of the vector population are developed. METHODS: One of the most comprehensive studies to date in terms of gathering entomological and parasitological information from the literature was undertaken for the development of a new version of an existing malaria model. The knowledge was needed to allow the justification of new settings of various model parameters and motivated changes of the mathematical formulation of the LMM. RESULTS: The first part of the present study developed an improved set of parameter settings and mathematical formulation of the LMM. Important modules of the original LMM version were enhanced in order to achieve a higher biological and physical accuracy. The oviposition as well as the survival of immature mosquitoes were adjusted to field conditions via the application of a fuzzy distribution model. Key model parameters, including the mature age of mosquitoes, the survival probability of adult mosquitoes, the human blood index, the mosquito-to-human (human-to-mosquito) transmission efficiency, the human infectious age, the recovery rate, as well as the gametocyte prevalence, were reassessed by means of entomological and parasitological observations. This paper also revealed that various malaria variables lack information from field studies to be set properly in a malaria modelling approach. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the multitude of model parameters and the uncertainty involved in the setting of parameters, an extensive literature survey was carried out, in order to produce a refined set of settings of various model parameters. This approach limits the degrees of freedom of the parameter space of the model, simplifying the final calibration of undetermined parameters (see the second part of this study). In addition, new mathematical formulations of important processes have improved the model in terms of the growth of the vector population.},

Here we reanalyse the antibody data from this challenge trial to determine whether IgG avidity may help to explain efficacy better than IgG titre alone by adapting a within-host mathematical model of sporozoite inoculation. We demonstrate that a model incorporating titre and avidity provides a substantially better fit to the data than titre alone. These results also suggest that in individuals with a high antibody titre response that also show high avidity (both metrics in the top tercile of observed values) delayed-fractional vaccination provided near perfect protection upon first challenge (98.2\% [95\% Credible Interval 91.6-99.7\%]). This finding suggests that the quality of the vaccine induced antibody response is likely to be an important determinant in the development of highly efficacious pre-erythrocytic vaccines against malaria.},

	abstract = {Summary Background COVID-19 has the potential to cause substantial disruptions to health services, due to cases overburdening the health system or response measures limiting usual programmatic activities. We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. Methods Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3·0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10\%, 20\%, and 36\%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. Interpretation Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The estimated short-term effects of air temperature and precipitation are nonlinear, in agreement with previous research and the ecology of the disease. These effects are robust to the effects of temporal correlation. The effects of socioeconomic data are difficult to ascertain and require further evaluation with longer time series.

	abstract = {Background: Although malaria burden in Uganda has declined since 2009 following the scale-up of interventions, the disease is still the leading cause of hospitalization and death. Transmission remains high and is driven by suitable weather conditions. There is a real concern that intervention gains may be reversed by climatic changes in the country. In this study, we investigate the effects of climate on the spatio-temporal trends of malaria incidence in Uganda during 2013-2017. Methods: Bayesian spatio-temporal negative binomial models were fitted on district-aggregated monthly malaria cases, reported by two age groups, defined by a cut-off age of 5 years. Weather data was obtained from remote sensing sources including rainfall, day land surface temperature (LSTD) and night land surface temperature (LSTN), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), altitude, land cover, and distance to water bodies. Spatial and temporal correlations were taken into account by assuming a conditional autoregressive and a first-order autoregressive process on district and monthly specific random effects, respectively. Fourier trigonometric functions modeled seasonal fluctuations in malaria transmission. The effects of climatic changes on the malaria incidence changes between 2013 and 2017 were estimated by modeling the difference in time varying climatic conditions at the two time points and adjusting for the effects of intervention coverage, socio-economic status and health seeking behavior. Results: Malaria incidence declined steadily from 2013 to 2015 and then increased in 2016. The decrease was by over 38\% and 20\% in children {\textless}5 years and individuals \${\textbackslash}geq\$5 years, respectively. Temporal trends depict a strong bi-annual seasonal pattern with two peaks during April-June and October-December. The annual average of rainfall, LSTD and LSTN increased by 3.7 mm, 2.2 °C and 1.0 °C, respectively, between 2013 and 2017, whereas NDVI decreased by 6.8\%. On the one hand, the increase in LSTD and decrease in NDVI were associated with a reduction in the incidence decline. On the other hand, malaria interventions and treatment seeking behavior had reverse effects, that were stronger compared to the effects of climatic changes. Important interactions between interventions with NDVI and LSTD suggest a varying impact of interventions on malaria burden in different climatic conditions. Conclusion: Climatic changes in Uganda during the last five years contributed to a favorable environment for malaria transmission, and had a detrimental effect on malaria reduction gains achieved through interventions scale-up efforts. The NMCP should create synergies with the National Meteorological Authority with an ultimate goal of developing a Malaria Early Warning System to mitigate adverse climatic change effects on malaria risk in the country.},

	abstract = {Malaria forecasts from dynamical systems have never been attempted at the health district or local clinic catchment scale, and so their usefulness for public health preparedness and response at the local level is fundamentally unknown. A pilot preoperational forecasting system is introduced in which the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction system and seasonal climate forecasts of temperature and rainfall are used to drive the uncalibrated dynamical malaria model VECTRI to predict anomalies in transmission intensity 4 months ahead. It is demonstrated that the system has statistically significant skill at a number of sentinel sites in Uganda with high-quality data. Skill is also found at approximately 50\% of the Ugandan health districts despite inherent uncertainties of unconfirmed health reports. A cost-loss economic analysis at three example sentinel sites indicates that the forecast system can have a positive economic benefit across a broad range of intermediate cost-loss ratios and frequency of transmission anomalies. We argue that such an analysis is a necessary first step in the attempt to translate climate-driven malaria information to policy-relevant decisions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measurement of densities of host-seeking malaria vectors is important for estimating levels of disease transmission, for appropriately allocating interventions, and for quantifying their impact. The gold standard for estimating mosquito-human contact rates is the human landing catch (HLC), where human volunteers catch mosquitoes that land on their exposed body parts. This approach necessitates exposure to potentially infectious mosquitoes, and is very labour intensive. There are several safer and less labour-intensive methods, with Centers for Disease Control light traps (LT) placed indoors near occupied bed nets being the most widely used. METHODS: This paper presents analyses of 13 studies with paired mosquito collections of LT and HLC to evaluate these methods for their consistency in sampling indoor-feeding mosquitoes belonging to the two major taxa of malaria vectors across Africa, the Anopheles gambiae sensu lato complex and the Anopheles funestus s.l. group. Both overall and study-specific sampling efficiencies of LT compared with HLC were computed, and regression methods that allow for the substantial variations in mosquito counts made by either method were used to test whether the sampling efficacy varies with mosquito density. RESULTS: Generally, LT were able to collect similar numbers of mosquitoes to the HLC indoors, although the relative sampling efficacy, measured by the ratio of LT:HLC varied considerably between studies. The overall best estimate for An. gambiae s.l. was 1.06 (95\% credible interval: 0.68-1.64) and for An. funestus s.l. was 1.37 (0.70-2.68). Local calibration exercises are not reproducible, since only in a few studies did LT sample proportionally to HLC, and there was no geographical pattern or consistent trend with average density in the tendency for LT to either under- or over-sample. CONCLUSIONS: LT are a crude tool at best, but are relatively easy to deploy on a large scale. Spatial and temporal variation in mosquito densities and human malaria transmission exposure span several orders of magnitude, compared to which the inconsistencies of LT are relatively small. LT, therefore, remain an invaluable and safe alternative to HLC for measuring indoor malaria transmission exposure in Africa.},

	abstract = {Malaria connectivity describes the flow of parasites among transmission sources and sinks within a given landscape. Because of the spatial and temporal scales at which parasites are transported by their hosts, malaria sub-populations are largely defined by mosquito movement and malaria connectivity among them is largely driven by human movement. Characterising malaria connectivity thus requires characterising human travel between areas with differing levels of exposure to malaria. Whilst understanding malaria connectivity is fundamental for optimising interventions, particularly in areas seeking or sustaining elimination, there is a dearth of human movement data required to achieve this goal. Malaria indicator surveys (MIS) are a generally under utilised but potentially rich source of travel data that provide a unique opportunity to study simple associations between malaria infection and human travel in large population samples. This paper shares the experience working with MIS data from Bioko Island that revealed programmatically useful information regarding malaria importation through human travel. Simple additions to MIS questionnaires greatly augmented the level of detail of the travel data, which can be used to characterise human travel patterns and malaria connectivity to assist targeting interventions. It is argued that MIS potentially represent very important and timely sources of travel data that need to be further exploited.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In malaria elimination settings, available metrics for malaria surveillance have been insufficient to measure the performance of passive case detection adequately. An indicator for malaria suspected cases with malaria test (MSCT) is proposed to measure the rate of testing on persons presenting to health facilities who satisfy the definition of a suspected malaria case. This metric does not rely on prior knowledge of fever prevalence, seasonality, or external denominators, and can be used to compare detection rates in suspected cases within and between countries, including across settings with different levels of transmission. METHODS: To compute the MSCT, an operational definition for suspected malaria cases was established, including clinical and epidemiological criteria. In general, suspected cases included: (1) persons with fever detected in areas with active malaria transmission; (2) persons with fever identified in areas with no active transmission and travel history to, or residence in areas with active transmission (either national or international); and (3) persons presenting with fever, chills and sweating from any area. Data was collected from 9 countries: Belize, Colombia (in areas with active transmission), Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama (September-March 2020). A sample of eligible medical records for 2018 was selected from a sample of health facilities in each country. An algorithm was constructed to assess if a malaria test was ordered or performed for cases that met the suspected case definition. RESULTS: A sample of 5873 suspected malaria cases was obtained from 239 health facilities. Except for Nicaragua and Colombia, malaria tests were requested in less than 10\% of all cases. More cases were tested in areas with active transmission than areas without cases. Travel history was not systematically recorded in any country. CONCLUSIONS: A statistically comparable, replicable, and standardized metric was proposed to measure suspected malaria cases with a test (microscopy or rapid diagnostic test) that enables assessing the performance of passive case detection. Cross-country findings have important implications for malaria and infectious disease surveillance, which should be promptly addressed as countries progress towards malaria elimination. Local and easy-to-implement tools could be implemented to assess and improve passive case detection.},

	abstract = {Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, are responsible for more than 50 million infections worldwide every year, with an overall increase of 30-fold in the last 50 years, mainly due to city population growth, more frequent travels and ecological changes. In the United States of America, the vast majority of Aedes-borne infections are imported from endemic regions by travelers, who can become new sources of mosquito infection upon their return home if the exposed population is susceptible to the disease, and if suitable environmental conditions for the mosquitoes and the virus are present. Since the susceptibility of the human population can be determined via periodic monitoring campaigns, the environmental suitability for the presence of mosquitoes and viruses becomes one of the most important pieces of information for decision makers in the health sector. We present a next-generation monitoring and forecasting system for [Formula: see text]-borne diseases' environmental suitability (AeDES) of transmission in the conterminous United States and transboundary regions, using calibrated ento-epidemiological models, climate models and temperature observations. After analyzing the seasonal predictive skill of AeDES, we briefly consider the recent Zika epidemic, and the compound effects of the current Central American dengue outbreak happening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to illustrate how a combination of tailored deterministic and probabilistic forecasts can inform key prevention and control strategies .},

	abstract = {Forecasting the impacts of climate change on Aedes-borne viruses-especially dengue, chikungunya, and Zika-is a key component of public health preparedness. We apply an empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3-34.0°C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9-29.4°C for Ae. albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-driven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmission risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to increased net and new exposures to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate of acquisition of naturally acquired immunity (NAI) against malaria predominantly depends on transmission intensity and age, although disentangling the effects of these is difficult. We used chemoprophylaxis to selectively control exposure to P. falciparum during different periods in infancy and explore the effect of age in the build-up of NAI, measured as risk of clinical malaria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A three-arm double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 349 infants born to Mozambican HIV-negative women. The late exposure group (LEG) received monthly Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) plus Artesunate (AS) from 2.5-4.5 months of age and monthly placebo from 5.5-9.5 months; the early exposure group (EEG) received placebo from 2.5-4.5 months and SP+AS from 5.5-9.5 months; and the control group (CG) received placebo from 2.5-9.5 months. Active and passive case detection (PCD) were conducted from birth to 10.5 and 24 months respectively. The primary endpoint was time to first or only episode of malaria in the second year detected by PCD. The incidence of malaria during the second year was of 0.50, 0.51 and 0.35 episodes/PYAR in the LEG, EEG and CG respectively (p = 0.379 for the adjusted comparison of the 3 groups). The hazard ratio of the adjusted comparison between the LEG and the CG was 1.38 (0.83-2.28, p = 0.642) and that between the EEG and the CG was 1.35 (0.81-2.24, p = 0.743). CONCLUSIONS: After considerably interfering with exposure during the first year of life, there was a trend towards a higher risk of malaria in the second year in children who had received chemoprophylaxis, but there was no significant rebound. No evidence was found that the age of first exposure to malaria affects the rate of acquisition of NAI. Thus, the timing of administration of antimalarial interventions like malaria vaccines during infancy does not appear to be a critical determinant.

EIP is known to be temperature-dependent but this relationship is surprisingly poorly characterized. There is a single degree-day model for EIP of Plasmodium falciparum that derives from a limited number of poorly controlled studies conducted almost a century ago. Here, we show that the established degree-day model greatly underestimates the rate of development of P. falciparum in both Anopheles stephensi and An. gambiae mosquitoes at temperatures in the range of 17-20°C. We also show that realistic daily temperature fluctuation further speeds parasite development.

The parasites accumulate in the hosts according to an immigration-death-process where the immigration rate is an arbitrary function of the average parasite load in the total host population. The presence of parasites in a host increases his death rate proportional to the number of parasites present. After deriving a partial differential equation with a nonlinearity containing integrals of the unknown function we reduce the equation to an integral equation for the immigration rate of parasites. We shall prove local existence and uniqueness. Under quite natural conditions there is a zero stationary solution and a bifurcating branch of positive solutions. The zero solution is linearly stable below the bifurcation point. For large transmission rate the asymptotic behavior of the average parasite load per host and of the life expectancy of the hosts and of the parasites is determined.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intensive malaria control may have additional benefits beyond reducing the incidence of symptomatic malaria. We compared antibiotic treatment of children before and after the implementation of highly effective malaria control interventions in Tororo, a historically high transmission area of Uganda. METHODS: Two successive cohorts of children, aged 0.5 to 10 years, were followed from September 2011 to October 2019 in a dedicated study clinic. Universal distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets was conducted in 2013 and 2017. Sustained indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) was initiated in December 2014. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to compare the incidence of antimalarial and antibiotic treatments before and after vector control measures were implemented. RESULTS: Comparing the period prior to the implementation of IRS to the period after IRS had been sustained for 4-5 years, the adjusted incidence of malaria treatments decreased from 2.68 to 0.05 per person-year (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.02, 95\% CI 0.01-0.03, p {\textless} 0.001), and the adjusted incidence of antibiotic treatments decreased from 4.14 to 1.26 per person-year (IRR = 0.30, 95\% CI 0.27-0.34, p {\textless} 0.001). The reduction in antibiotic usage was primarily associated with fewer episodes of symptomatic malaria and fewer episodes of fever with sub-microscopic parasitemia, both of which were frequently treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: In a historically high transmission setting, the implementation of highly effective vector control interventions was followed by a marked reduction in antibiotic treatment of children. This added benefit of malaria control could have important implications for antibiotic prescribing practices, efforts to curtail antimicrobial resistance, and health system costs.},

In Sicily a new network of 95 GSM meteorological stations and a specific mathematical model for Aonidiella aurantii are used by Sicilian Agrometeorological Information System (SIAS) for the integrated pest management program of citrus orchards in the Island. As the plants parasites, vector borne diseases are influenced by climate in their appearance and abundance. In lights of the benefits that could derive from a model for the control of Leishmania vectors, SIAS experiences in modelling were used to develop a deductive model for Phlebotomus perniciosus which represents the major vector of human and canine leishmaniasis in Sicily.},

	abstract = {Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans primarily via the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes. The virus caused a major epidemic in the Indian Ocean in 2004, affecting millions of inhabitants, while cases have also been observed in Europe since 2007. We developed a stochastic spatiotemporal model of Aedes albopictus-borne chikungunya transmission based on our recently developed environmentally-driven vector population dynamics model. We designed an integrated modelling framework incorporating large-scale gridded climate datasets to investigate disease outbreaks on Reunion Island and in Italy. We performed Bayesian parameter inference on the surveillance data, and investigated the validity and applicability of the underlying biological assumptions. The model successfully represents the outbreak and measures of containment in Italy, suggesting wider applicability in Europe. In its current configuration, the model implies two different viral strains, thus two different outbreaks, for the two-stage Reunion Island epidemic. Characterisation of the posterior distributions indicates a possible relationship between the second larger outbreak on Reunion Island and the Italian outbreak. The model suggests that vector control measures, with different modes of operation, are most effective when applied in combination: adult vector intervention has a high impact but is short-lived, larval intervention has a low impact but is long-lasting, and quarantining infected territories, if applied strictly, is effective in preventing large epidemics. We present a novel approach in analysing chikungunya outbreaks globally using a single environmentally-driven mathematical model. Our study represents a significant step towards developing a globally applicable Ae. albopictus-borne chikungunya transmission model, and introduces a guideline for extending such models to other vector-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {Abstract Malaria, dengue, Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose a major global health burden through much of the world, despite the widespread distribution of insecticide-based tools and antimalarial drugs. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing and its demonstrated ability to streamline the development of gene drive systems has reignited interest in the application of this technology to the control of mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit. The versatility of this technology has enabled a wide range of gene drive architectures to be realized, creating a need for their population-level and spatial dynamics to be explored. We present MGDrivE (Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer): a simulation framework designed to investigate the population dynamics of a variety of gene drive architectures and their spread through spatially explicit mosquito populations. A key strength of the MGDrivE framework is its modularity: (a) a genetic inheritance module accommodates the dynamics of gene drive systems displaying user-defined inheritance patterns, (b) a population dynamic module accommodates the life history of a variety of mosquito disease vectors and insect agricultural pests, and (c) a landscape module generates the metapopulation model by which insect populations are connected via migration over space. Example MGDrivE simulations are presented to demonstrate the application of the framework to CRISPR/Cas9-based homing gene drive for: (a) driving a disease-refractory gene into a population (i.e. population replacement), and (b) disrupting a gene required for female fertility (i.e. population suppression), incorporating homing-resistant alleles in both cases. Further documentation and use examples are provided at the project's Github repository. MGDrivE is an open-source r package freely available on CRAN. We intend the package to provide a flexible tool capable of modelling novel inheritance-modifying constructs as they are proposed and become available. The field of gene drive is moving very quickly, and we welcome suggestions for future development.},

Climate change has been proposed as a likely driver of past and future expansion, however, the complex ecology of host and vector populations and their interactions with each other, environmental variables and land-use changes makes understanding the likely impacts of climate change on VBDs challenging. We present an environmentally driven, stage-structured, host-vector mathematical modelling framework to address this challenge. We apply our framework to predict the risk of WNV outbreaks in current and future UK climates. WNV is a mosquito-borne arbovirus which has expanded its range in mainland Europe in recent years. We predict that, while risks will remain low in the coming two to three decades, the risk of WNV outbreaks in the UK will increase with projected temperature rises and outbreaks appear plausible in the latter half of this century. This risk will increase substantially if increased temperatures lead to increases in the length of the mosquito biting season or if European strains show higher replication at lower temperatures than North American strains.},

We show a strong and significant effect of humidity during the pre-transmission season on malaria burden in coastal Surat and more arid inland Ahmedabad. Simulations of the climate-driven transmission model with the MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimates) of the parameters retrospectively capture the observed variability of disease incidence, and also prospectively predict that of 'out-of-fit' cases in more recent years, with high accuracy. Our findings indicate that relative humidity is a critical factor in the spread of urban malaria and potentially other vector-borne epidemics, and that climate change and lack of hydrological planning in cities might jeopardize malaria elimination efforts.},

The proportion of mosquitoes infected is primarily determined by the density of female gametocytes though transmission from low gametocyte densities may be impeded by a lack of male parasites. Improved precision of gametocyte quantification simplifies the shape of the relationship with infection increasing rapidly before plateauing at higher densities. The mean number of oocysts per mosquito rises quickly with gametocyte density but continues to increase across densities examined. The work highlights the importance of measuring both female and male gametocyte density when estimating the human reservoir of infection.},

Its full length cDNA encodes a 278-aa protein that has 43\% amino acid identity with BmJHAMT, a juvenile hormone acid methyltransferase previously cloned from Bombyx mori. Heterologous expression produced a recombinant protein that metabolizes farnesoic acid (FA) into methyl farnesoate, as well as juvenile hormone acid into juvenile hormone III (JH III) with exquisite stereo specificity. Real time PCR experiments showed that JHAMT mRNA levels are not an unequivocal indicator of JH III synthesis rates; the A. aegypti JHAMT gene, silent in female pupae, was transcriptionally activated just 4–6h before adult eclosion. Radiochemical methyltransferase assays using active and inactive corpora allata glands (CA) dissected from sugar and blood-fed females respectively, clearly indicated that significant levels of JHAMT enzymatic activity are present when the CA shows very low spontaneous rates of JH III synthesis. Having the last enzymes of the JH synthetic pathway readily available all the time might be critical for the adult female mosquito to sustain rapid dynamic changes in JH III synthesis in response to nutritional changes or peripheral influences, such as mating or feeding. These results suggest that this gene has different roles in the regulation of JH synthesis in pupal and adult female mosquitoes, and support the hypothesis that the rate-limiting steps in JH III synthesis in adult female mosquitoes are located before entrance of FA into the synthetic pathway.},

In this paper, we take a mosquito-centric approach by studying mosquito states (i.e., energy, neurological health, and toxin information state) to demonstrate how key parameters of malaria, biting and movement rates and mosquito survival, are all emergent properties of those states when considered in the context of the background community interactions. We do so as follows: First, we develop a dynamic state variable model of mosquito biting and movement decisions that maximize mosquito expected reproductive success (fitness), and then we embed those optimal policies in a Monte Carlo simulation wherein mosquitoes attempt to feed on human hosts at domiciles where insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and insecticidal residual wall sprays (IRSs) are used. We find that biting rates, at the domicile level, are not impacted by mosquito state but that emigration rates from domiciles are determined by an interaction between mosquito energy state, information state, and risk of predation. This means that malaria incidence, at the village level at least, may be best understood as a response of mosquitoes to their ecological community that includes nectar-bearing plants, predators, the spatial arrangement of homes, and the protection of humans in those homes.},

In light of this, we assayed the response of females when disturbed during a blood meal, in a size-energy state factorial experiment. We found that a mosquito's decision to abandon its host is dependent not only on its relative blood intake, but also on its size and energy state. In particular, mosquitoes are more likely to terminate feeding with increasing relative blood meal size, with the exception of small, high-energy ones, on which they tend to continue feeding. Mosquitoes that have engaged in prediuresis also tend to abandon their host more readily than those that have not. We discuss our results with regards to the marginal returns in fitness (via fecundity) of continuing feeding for body size, energy state, and interactions.},

Moreover, within a given species, the decision to join or avoid others can be affected markedly by the physiological and informational state of the individual and by contextual response thresholds to resource availability.

In another experiment, females showed an oviposition preference for LRW sites that were devoid of A. togoi eggs compared with those harboring 50 (0.3 eggs/mL) conspecific eggs. Further, it was discovered that females laid their eggs at several sites rather than at a single suitable site. Possible reasons for such choices are discussed.},

By contrast, both 48 and 72-h individuals showed high response to foot odor, longer residence time, and higher probing rates. Seventy-two-h females also flew towards the honey source less often than other groups.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transmission of Plasmodium greatly depends on the foraging behaviour of its mosquito vector (Anopheles spp.). The accessibility of blood hosts and availability of plant sugar (i.e., nectar) sources, together with mosquito energy state, have been shown to modulate blood feeding (and thus biting rates) of anopheline mosquitoes. In this study, the influence of mosquito starvation status and availability of nectar on the decision of female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes to leave a bed net-protected blood host was examined. METHODS: Two small-scale mesocosm experiments were conducted using female mosquitoes starved for 0, 24 or 48 h, that were released inside a specially constructed hut with mesh-sealed exits and containing a bed net-protected human volunteer. Floral cues were positioned on one side of the hut or the other. Several biologically plausible exponential decay models were developed that characterized the emigration rates of mosquitoes from the huts. These varied from simple random loss to leaving rates dependent upon energy state and time. These model fits were evaluated by examining their fitted parameter estimates and comparing Akaike information criterion. RESULTS: Starved mosquitoes left domiciles at a higher rate than recently fed individuals however, there was no difference between 1- and 2-day-starved mosquitoes. There was also no effect of floral cue placement. The best fitting emigration model was one based on both mosquito energy state and time whereas the worst fitting model was one based on the assumption of constant leaving rates, independent of time and energy state. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that mosquito-leaving behaviour is energy-state dependent, and provide some of the first evidence of state-dependent domicile emigration in An. gambiae, which may play a role in malarial transmission dynamics. Employment of simple, first-principle, mechanistic models can be very useful to our understanding of why and how mosquitoes leave domiciles.},

It is, in fact, extremely unfortunate that the early emphasis in behavioral ecology on optimization deflected discussion of more important concepts (Mangel and Ludwig 1992). In particular, the focus became one of “testing the optimization model” (in which case any variation of behavior disproves the theory) rather than considering fitness consequences of different behaviors (see Mangel and Clark 1988, Mangel and Ludwig 1992).},

Should the density of competing individuals exceed the carrying capacity of a unit of resource, the result may be detrimental to fitness. Therefore, selection should favor avoidance of overcrowding. In some species, however, too low a density of individuals on a unit of resource may have equally detrimental consequences to fitness. Here, selection should favor some degree of aggregation, short of overcrowding. Thus, we may consider the concept of an optimal density range of individuals per unit of resource as valid (Peters and Barbosa, 1977; Prokopy, 1981a).},

Implementation of indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide, a proven vector control intervention, has been limited and difficult to sustain partly because questions remain on its added impact over widely accepted interventions such as bed nets. Using data from 14 enhanced surveillance health facilities in Uganda, a country with high bed net coverage yet high malaria burden, we estimate the impact of starting and stopping IRS on changes in malaria incidence. We show that stopping IRS was associated with a 5-fold increase in malaria incidence within 10 months, but reinstating IRS was associated with an over 5-fold decrease within 8 months. In areas where IRS was initiated and sustained, malaria incidence dropped by 85\% after year 4. IRS could play a critical role in achieving global malaria targets, particularly in areas where progress has stalled.},

This issue is particularly acute for infectious diseases like malaria, which often impact rural and remote communities the hardest. In Guyana, a country located in South America, poor connectivity among remote malaria-endemic regions hampers surveillance efforts, making reporting delays a key challenge for elimination. Here, we analyze 13 years of malaria surveillance data, identifying key correlates of time lags between clinical cases occurring and being added to the central data system. We develop nowcasting methods that use historical patterns of reporting delays to estimate occurred-but-not-reported monthly malaria cases. To assess their performance, we implemented them retrospectively, using only information that would have been available at the time of estimation, and found that they substantially enhanced the estimates of malaria cases. Specifically, we found that the best performing models achieved up to two-fold improvements in accuracy (or error reduction) over known cases in selected regions. Our approach provides a simple, generalizable tool to improve malaria surveillance in endemic countries and is currently being implemented to help guide existing resource allocation and elimination efforts.},

	abstract = {Tororo, a district in Uganda with historically high malaria transmission intensity, has recently scaled up control interventions, including universal long-lasting insecticidal net distribution in 2013 and 2017, and sustained indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide since December 2014. We describe the burden of malaria in Tororo 5 years following the initiation of IRS. We followed a cohort of 531 participants from 80 randomly selected households in Nagongera subcounty, Tororo district, from October 2017 to October 2019. Mosquitoes were collected every 2 weeks using CDC light traps in all rooms where participants slept, symptomatic malaria was identified by passive surveillance, and microscopic and submicroscopic parasitemia were measured every 4 weeks using active surveillance. Over the 2 years of follow-up, 15,780 female anopheline mosquitos were collected, the majority (98.0\%) of which were Anopheles arabiensis. The daily human biting rate was 2.07, and the annual entomological inoculation rate was 0.43 infective bites/person/year. Only 38 episodes of malaria were diagnosed (incidence 0.04 episodes/person/year), and there were no cases of severe malaria or malarial deaths. The prevalence of microscopic parasitemia was 1.9\%, and the combined prevalence of microscopic and submicroscopic parasitemia was 10.4\%, each highest in children aged 5-15 years (3.3\% and 14.0\%, respectively). After 5 years of intensive vector control measures in Tororo, the burden of malaria was reduced to very low transmission levels. However, a significant proportion of the population remained parasitemic, primarily school-aged children with submicroscopic parasitemia, providing a potential reservoir for malaria transmission.},

In contrast, females cleared asymptomatic infections at a faster rate than males (hazard ratio [HR]=1.82, 95\% CI 1.20 to 2.75 by clone and HR = 2.07, 95\% CI 1.24 to 3.47 by infection event) in multivariate models adjusted for age, timing of infection onset, and parasite density.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate estimation of the burden of Plasmodium falciparum is essential for strategic planning for control and elimination. Due in part to the extreme heterogeneity in malaria exposure, immunity, other causes of disease, direct measurements of fever and disease attributable to malaria can be difficult. This can make a comparison of epidemiological metrics both within and between populations hard to interpret. An essential part of untangling this is an understanding of the complex time-course of malaria infections. METHODS: Historic data from malariatherapy infections, in which individuals were intentionally infected with malaria parasites, were reexamined in aggregate. In this analysis, the age of each infection was examined as a potential predictor describing aggregate patterns across all infections. A series of piecewise linear and generalized linear regressions were performed to highlight the infection age-dependent patterns in both parasitaemia and gametocytaemia, and from parasitaemia and gametocytaemia to fever and transmission probabilities, respectively. RESULTS: The observed duration of untreated patent infection was 130 days. As infections progressed, the fraction of infections subpatent by microscopy was seen to increase steadily. The time-averaged malaria infections had three distinct phases in parasitaemia: a growth phase for the first 6 days of patency, a rapid decline from day 6 to day 18, and a slowly declining chronic phase for the remaining duration of the infection. During the growth phase, parasite densities increased sharply to a peak. Densities sharply decline for a short period of time after the peak. During the chronic phase, infections declined steadily as infections age. gametocytaemia was strongly correlated with lagged asexual parasitaemia. Fever rates and transmission efficiency were strongly correlated with parasitaemia and gametocytaemia. The comparison between raw data and prediction from the age of infection has good qualitative agreement across all quantities of interest for predicting averaged effects. CONCLUSION: The age of infection was established as a potentially useful covariate for malaria epidemiology. Infection age can be estimated given a history of exposure, and accounting for exposure history may potentially provide a new way to estimate malaria-attributable fever rates, transmission efficiency, and patent fraction in immunologically naïve individuals such as children and people in low-transmission regions. These data were collected from American adults with neurosyphilis, so there are reasons to be cautious about extending the quantitative results reported here to general populations in malaria-endemic regions. Understanding how immune responses modify these statistical relationships given past exposure is key for being able to apply these results more broadly.},

Interleukin 12 (IL12) significantly boosts erythropoietic responses in murine models of malarial anaemia and decreased IL12 levels are associated with severe malarial anaemia (SMA) in children. Based on the biological relevance of IL12 in malaria anaemia, the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of IL12 and its receptors and SMA was examined. METHODS: Fifty-five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms covering genes encoding two IL12 subunits, IL12A and IL12B, and its receptors, IL12RB1 and IL12RB2, were examined in a cohort of 913 children residing in Asembo Bay region of western Kenya. RESULTS: An increasing copy number of minor variant (C) in IL12A (rs2243140) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of SMA (P = 0.006; risk ratio, 0.52 for carrying one copy of allele C and 0.28 for two copies). Individuals possessing two copies of a rare variant (C) in IL12RB1 (rs429774) also appeared to be strongly protective against SMA (P = 0.00005; risk ratio, 0.18). In addition, children homozygous for another rare allele (T) in IL12A (rs22431348) were associated with reduced risk of severe anaemia (SA) (P = 0.004; risk ratio, 0.69) and of severe anaemia with any parasitaemia (SAP) (P = 0.004; risk ratio, 0.66). In contrast, AG genotype for another variant in IL12RB1 (rs383483) was associated with susceptibility to high-density parasitaemia (HDP) (P = 0.003; risk ratio, 1.21). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown strong associations between polymorphisms in the genes of IL12A and IL12RB1 and protection from SMA in Kenyan children, suggesting that human genetic variants of IL12 related genes may significantly contribute to the development of anaemia in malaria patients.},

Public health provision has been affected particularly. In this Review, we assess the impact of Venezuela's health-care crisis on vector-borne diseases, and the spillover into neighbouring countries. Between 2000 and 2015, Venezuela witnessed a 359\% increase in malaria cases, followed by a 71\% increase in 2017 (411 586 cases) compared with 2016 (240 613). Neighbouring countries, such as Brazil, have reported an escalating trend of imported malaria cases from Venezuela, from 1538 in 2014 to 3129 in 2017. In Venezuela, active Chagas disease transmission has been reported, with seroprevalence in children ({\textless}10 years), estimated to be as high as 12·5\% in one community tested (n=64). Dengue incidence increased by more than four times between 1990 and 2016. The estimated incidence of chikungunya during its epidemic peak is 6975 cases per 100 000 people and that of Zika virus is 2057 cases per 100 000 people. The re-emergence of many vector-borne diseases represents a public health crisis in Venezuela and has the possibility of severely undermining regional disease elimination efforts.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the effect of malaria control interventions on vector and parasite populations, acquired immunity, and burden of the disease is needed to guide strategies to eliminate malaria from highly endemic areas. We monitored and analysed the changes in malaria epidemiology in a village community in Senegal, west Africa, over 22 years. METHODS: Between 1990 and 2012, we did a prospective longitudinal study of the inhabitants of Dielmo, Senegal, to identify all episodes of fever and investigate the relation between malaria host, vector, and parasite. Our study included daily medical surveillance with systematic parasite detection in individuals with fever. We measured parasite prevalence four times a year with cross-sectional surveys. We monitored malaria transmission monthly with night collection of mosquitoes. Malaria treatment changed over the years, from quinine (1990-94), to chloroquine (1995-2003), amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (2003-06), and finally artesunate plus amodiaquine (2006-12). Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) were introduced in 2008. FINDINGS: We monitored 776 villagers aged 0-101 years for 2 378 150 person-days of follow-up. Entomological inoculation rate ranged from 142·5 infected bites per person per year in 1990 to 482·6 in 2000, and 7·6 in 2012. Parasite prevalence in children declined from 87\% in 1990 to 0·3 \% in 2012. In adults, it declined from 58\% to 0·3\%. We recorded 23 546 fever episodes during the study, including 8243 clinical attacks caused by Plasmodium falciparum, 290 by Plasmodium malariae, and 219 by Plasmodium ovale. Three deaths were directly attributable to malaria, and two to severe adverse events of antimalarial drugs. The incidence of malaria attacks ranged from 1·50 attacks per person-year in 1990 to 2·63 in 2000, and to only 0·046 in 2012. The greatest changes were associated with the replacement of chloroquine and the introduction of ITNs. INTERPRETATION: Malaria control policies combining prompt treatment of clinical attacks and deployment of ITNs can nearly eliminate parasite carriage and greatly reduce the burden of malaria in populations exposed to intense perennial malaria transmission. The choice of drugs seems crucial. Rapid decline of clinical immunity allows rapid detection and treatment of novel infections and thus has a key role in sustaining effectiveness of combining artemisinin-based combination therapy and ITNs despite increasing pyrethroid resistance.

The case study is the DF outbreak in the Chinese city of Guangzhou throughout the year of 2002–the most serious DF outbreak in the recent decade. This study shows that the presence and abundance of DF cases can be associated with (a) socioeconomic factors relating to urbanization and (b) meteorological factors favoring mosquito survival.},

We described and quantified the spatial and temporal events after the introduction and propagation of chikungunya into an immunologically naive population from the urban north-central region of Venezuela during 2014. The epidemic curve (n = 810 cases) unraveled within 5 months with a basic reproductive number of 3.7 and a radial spread traveled distance of 9.4 km at a mean velocity of 82.9 m/day. The highest disease diffusion speed occurred during the first 90 days, and space and space-time modeling suggest the epidemic followed a particular geographic pathway with spatiotemporal aggregation. The directionality and heterogeneity of transmission during the first introduction of chikungunya indicated existence of areas of diffusion and elevated risk for disease and highlight the importance of epidemic preparedness. This information will help in managing future threats of new or reemerging arboviruses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-level of malaria transmission persist in Zanzibar despite high coverage of core vector control interventions. This study was carried out in hot-spot sites to better understand entomological factors that may contribute to residual malaria transmission in Zanzibar. METHODS: A total of 135 households were randomly selected from six sites and consented to participate with 20-25 households per site. Mosquito vector surveillance was carried out indoors and outdoors from 6:00 pm-7:00 am using miniaturized double net trap (DN-Mini™). Additional collections were done indoors using mouth aspirators to retrieve resting mosquitoes from wall and ceiling surfaces, and outdoors using resting bucket and pit traps. All collected mosquitoes were morphologically and genetically (PCR) analysed in the laboratory. All collected anopheline and blood-fed mosquitoes were analysed for sporozoite infection and blood meal host preferences by Circumsporozoite Protein ELISA and blood meal ELISA, respectively. The differences between indoor and outdoor mosquito biting rates were analysed using generalized linear mixed models. Levels of resistance to commonly used insecticides were quantified by WHO susceptibility tests. RESULTS: Out of 704 malaria vectors collected across 135 households, PCR analysis shows that 98.60\% were Anopheles arabiensis, 0.6\% Anopheles merus and 0.6\% Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. Sporozoite ELISA analysis indicates that all mosquitoes were negative for the malaria parasite. The results show that more An. arabiensis were collected outdoor ( 85\%) compared to indoor ( 15\%). Furthermore, large numbers of An. arabiensis were caught in outdoor resting sites, where the pit trap (67.2\%) collected more mosquitoes compared to the outdoor DN-Mini trap (32.8\%). Nearly two-thirds (60.7\%) of blood-fed mosquitoes had obtained blood meals from non-human hosts. Mosquitoes displayed non-uniform susceptibility status and resistance intensity among the tested insecticides across the study sites to all WHO recommended insecticides across the study sites. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in contexts such as Zanzibar, testing of novel techniques to complement indoor protection and targeting outdoor biting and/or resting mosquitoes, may be warranted to complement existing interventions and contribute to malaria elimination efforts. The study highlights the need to implement novel interventions and/or adaptations of strategies that can target outdoors biting mosquitoes.},

	abstract = {A discrete reaction-diffusion model was used to estimate long-term equilibrium populations of a hypothetical species inhabiting patchy landscapes to examine the relative importance of habitat amount and arrangement in explaining population size. When examined over a broad range of habitat amounts and arrangements, population size was largely determined by a pure amount effect (proportion of habitat in the landscape accounted for {\textgreater}96\% of the total variation compared to {\textless}1\% for the arrangement main effect). However, population response deviated from a pure amount effect as coverage was reduced below 30\%-50\%. That deviation coincided with a persistence threshold as indicated by a rapid decline in the probability of landscapes supporting viable populations. When we partitioned experimental landscapes into sets of “above” and “below” persistence threshold, habitat arrangement became an important factor in explaining population size below threshold conditions. Regression analysis on below-threshold landscapes using explicit measures of landscape structure (after removing the covariation with habitat amount) indicated that arrangement variables accounted for 33\%-39\% of the variation in population size, compared to 27\%-49\% for habitat amount. Thus, habitat arrangement effects became important when species persistence became uncertain due to dispersal mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective targeting and evaluation of interventions that protect against adult malaria vectors requires an understanding of how gaps in personal protection arise. An improved understanding of human and mosquito behaviour, and how they overlap in time and space, is critical to estimating the impact of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and determining when and where supplemental personal protection tools are needed. Methods for weighting estimates of human exposure to biting Anopheles mosquitoes according to where people spend their time were first developed over half a century ago. However, crude indoor and outdoor biting rates are still commonly interpreted as indicative of human-vector contact patterns without any adjustment for human behaviour or the personal protection effects of ITNs. MAIN TEXT: A small number of human behavioural variables capturing the distribution of human populations indoors and outdoors, whether they are awake or asleep, and if and when they use an ITN over the course of the night, can enable a more accurate representation of human biting exposure patterns. However, to date no clear guidance is available on what data should be collected, what indicators should be reported, or how they should be calculated. This article presents an integrated perspective on relevant indicators of human-vector interactions, the critical entomological and human behavioural data elements required to quantify human-vector interactions, and recommendations for collecting and analysing such data. CONCLUSIONS: If collected and used consistently, this information can contribute to an improved understanding of how malaria transmission persists in the context of current intervention tools, how exposure patterns may change as new vector control tools are introduced, and the potential impact and limitations of these tools. This article is intended to consolidate understanding around work on this topic to date and provide a consistent framework for building upon it. Additional work is needed to address remaining questions, including further development and validation of methods for entomological and human behavioural data collection and analysis.},

The principle is based on a mathematical model of the sporozoite rate (the proportion of infective mosquitoes) that emphasized changes in mosquito age. Killing adult mosquitoes also reduces mosquito population densities, which are directly proportional to human biting rates (the number of bites, per person, per day). Eect sizes of vector control can be compared using sporozoite rates and human biting rates, which are commonly measured. We argue that human biting rates convey more use- ful information for planning, monitoring and evaluating vector control, and operational research should focus on understanding mosquito ecology.},

The probability that elimination would be cost-saving over 50 years ranged from 0\% to 42\%, with only one site achieving cost-savings in the base case.

	abstract = {Malaria draws global attention in a cyclic manner, with interest and associated financing waxing and waning according to political and humanitarian concerns. Currently we are on an upswing, which should be carefully developed. Malaria parasites have been eliminated from Europe and North America through the use of residual insecticides and manipulation of environmental and ecological characteristics; however, in many tropical and some temperate areas the incidence of disease is increasing dramatically. Much of this increase results from a breakdown of effective control methods developed and implemented in the 1960s, but it has also occurred because of a lack of trained scientists and control specialists who live and work in the areas of endemic infection. Add to this the widespread resistance to the most effective antimalarial drug, chloroquine, developing resistance to other first-line drugs such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and resistance of certain vector species of mosquito to some of the previously effective insecticides and we have a crisis situation. Vaccine research has proceeded for over 30 years, but as yet there is no effective product, although research continues in many promising areas. A global strategy for malaria control has been accepted, but there are critics who suggest that the single strategy cannot confront the wide range of conditions in which malaria exists and that reliance on chemotherapy without proper control of drug usage and diagnosis will select for drug resistant parasites, thus exacerbating the problem. An integrated approach to control using vector control strategies based on the biology of the mosquito, the epidemiology of the parasite, and human behavior patterns is needed to prevent continued upsurge in malaria in the endemic areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The simian malaria parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, can cause severe and fatal disease in humans yet it is rarely included in routine public health reporting systems for malaria and its geographical range is largely unknown. Because malaria caused by P. knowlesi is a truly neglected tropical disease, there are substantial obstacles to defining the geographical extent and risk of this disease. Information is required on the occurrence of human cases in different locations, on which non-human primates host this parasite and on which vectors are able to transmit it to humans. We undertook a systematic review and ranked the existing evidence, at a subnational spatial scale, to investigate the potential geographical range of the parasite reservoir capable of infecting humans. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After reviewing the published literature we identified potential host and vector species and ranked these based on how informative they are for the presence of an infectious parasite reservoir, based on current evidence. We collated spatial data on parasite occurrence and the ranges of the identified host and vector species. The ranked spatial data allowed us to assign an evidence score to 475 subnational areas in 19 countries and we present the results on a map of the Southeast and South Asia region. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have ranked subnational areas within the potential disease range according to evidence for presence of a disease risk to humans, providing geographical evidence to support decisions on prevention, management and prophylaxis. This work also highlights the unknown risk status of large parts of the region. Within this unknown category, our map identifies which areas have most evidence for the potential to support an infectious reservoir and are therefore a priority for further investigation. Furthermore we identify geographical areas where further investigation of putative host and vector species would be highly informative for the region-wide assessment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infection by the simian malaria parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, can lead to severe and fatal disease in humans, and is the most common cause of malaria in parts of Malaysia. Despite being a serious public health concern, the geographical distribution of P. knowlesi malaria risk is poorly understood because the parasite is often misidentified as one of the human malarias. Human cases have been confirmed in at least nine Southeast Asian countries, many of which are making progress towards eliminating the human malarias. Understanding the geographical distribution of P. knowlesi is important for identifying areas where malaria transmission will continue after the human malarias have been eliminated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 439 records of P. knowlesi infections in humans, macaque reservoir and vector species were collated. To predict spatial variation in disease risk, a model was fitted using records from countries where the infection data coverage is high. Predictions were then made throughout Southeast Asia, including regions where infection data are sparse. The resulting map predicts areas of high risk for P. knowlesi infection in a number of countries that are forecast to be malaria-free by 2025 (Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam) as well as countries projected to be eliminating malaria (Myanmar, Laos, Indonesia and the Philippines). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have produced the first map of P. knowlesi malaria risk, at a fine-scale resolution, to identify priority areas for surveillance based on regions with sparse data and high estimated risk. Our map provides an initial evidence base to better understand the spatial distribution of this disease and its potential wider contribution to malaria incidence. Considering malaria elimination goals, areas for prioritised surveillance are identified.},

Our models are informed by a suite of 111 predictor variables describing potential drivers of selection for resistance. Our maps show alarming increases in the prevalence of resistance to pyrethroids and DDT across sub-Saharan Africa from 2005 to 2017, with mean mortality following insecticide exposure declining from almost 100\% to less than 30\% in some areas, as well as substantial spatial variation in resistance trends.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of malaria in Uganda remains unacceptably high, especially among children and pregnant women. To prevent malaria related complications, household possession and use of Insecticide Treated mosquito Nets (ITNs) has become a common practice in the country. Despite the availability of ITNs, malaria remains a foremost public health concern in Uganda. We sought to explore knowledge, attitude, and behaviour towards the use of ITNs as a nightly malaria prevention strategy among pregnant women and children under five years of age in Isingiro district, Southwestern Uganda. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a community based, descriptive cross-sectional study, in which households with children under 5 years, and/or pregnant women were enrolled. We used a structured questionnaire to collect data on participants' understanding of the causes, signs and symptoms of malaria; use of ITNs to prevent malaria; attitudes and behaviours towards the use of ITNs. We also conducted key informant interviews (KIIs) to get in-depth understanding of responses from the participants. We analysed quantitative data using STATA version 12.Qualitative findings from the KIIs were transcribed and translated, and manually analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Of the 369 households enrolled, 98.4\% (N = 363) households had children under five. Most participants (41.2\%, N = 152) were in the 21-30 age category (mean age; 32.2 years). 98.1\% (N = 362) of the respondents considered ITNs a key malaria prevention strategy. The ITN possession rate was 84.0\% (N = 310), of these, 66.1\% (N = 205) consistently used them. 39\% of the respondents did not have a positive attitude towards ITNs. CONCLUSIONS: Although 84.0\% of the respondents possessed ITNs, many were not consistently using them. To this, there is need to engage all stakeholders (including cultural leaders, community health workers, religious leaders and the government) in the malaria prevention campaigns using ITNs through: a) government's concerted effort to ensure universal access of right fit ITNs, b) end-user directed health education to emphasize positive attributes of ITN use, c) telling the ITN success stories to improve on the usage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the biting patterns and seasonal abundances of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus mosquitoes in Kamuli District, Uganda. METHODS: Hourly indoor and outdoor catches of human biting mosquitoes were sampled from 19.00 to 07.00 hours for four consecutive nights each month using bed net traps in forty-eight houses randomly selected from Bugabula county where insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) had been used for at least five years and Budiope county where ITNs had not been used. The indoor and outdoor human-biting fractions, time of biting of the anophelines and climatic data were recorded from January to December 2010. Data were analysed using Multi-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-wallis rank sum test and Pearson correlation. The number of mosquitoes caught biting humans and resting indoors, the indoor and outdoor human biting densities and biting rates during different hours of the night, and mosquito abundances for a twelve-month sampling period in both zones are reported. RESULTS: Approximately four times more Anopheles mosquitoes were caught biting humans in Budiope County than in the Bugabula zone, with An. gambiae s. l. catches exceeding those of An. funestus. In both zones, peak night biting occurred between 23.00 and 05.00 hours. The majority of bites occurred between 03.00 and 06.00 hours for both Anopheles gambiae s. l. and funestus group. Outdoor biting densities of Anopheles gambiae s. l. exceeded the indoor biting densities throughout the night in both zones, while the indoor and outdoor human biting densities of An. funestus group were apparently equal. The outdoor and indoor human biting rates were similar in both zones. In Bugabula county, the abundance of An. gambiae s.l. was rainfall-dependent, while the An. funestus group could thrive with or without rain fall. In Budiope county, both An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus mosquitoes thrived all year round regardless of the amount of rainfall. CONCLUSION: Considering the biting patterns, and seasonal abundances exhibited by Anopheles gambiae s.l. and An. funestus mosquitoes in Kamuli district, intensive use of ITNs combined with indoor residual spraying, environmental management and improved house designs in the context of integrated vector management may be the appropriate vector control strategy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrated vector management (IVM) is increasingly being recommended as an option for sustainable malaria control. However, many malaria-endemic countries lack a policy framework to guide and promote the approach. The objective of the study was to assess knowledge and perceptions in relation to current malaria vector control policy and IVM in Uganda, and to make recommendations for consideration during future development of a specific IVM policy. METHODS: The study used a structured questionnaire to interview 34 individuals working at technical or policy-making levels in health, environment, agriculture and fisheries sectors. Specific questions on IVM focused on the following key elements of the approach: integration of chemical and non-chemical interventions of vector control; evidence-based decision making; inter-sectoral collaboration; capacity building; legislation; advocacy and community mobilization. RESULTS: All participants were familiar with the term IVM and knew various conventional malaria vector control (MVC) methods. Only 75\% thought that Uganda had a MVC policy. Eighty percent (80\%) felt there was inter-sectoral collaboration towards IVM, but that it was poor due to financial constraints, difficulties in involving all possible sectors and political differences. The health, environment and agricultural sectors were cited as key areas requiring cooperation in order for IVM to succeed. Sixty-seven percent (67\%) of participants responded that communities were actively being involved in MVC, while 48\% felt that the use of research results for evidence-based decision making was inadequate or poor. A majority of the participants felt that malaria research in Uganda was rarely used to facilitate policy changes. Suggestions by participants for formulation of specific and effective IVM policy included: revising the MVC policy and IVM-related policies in other sectors into a single, unified IVM policy and, using legislation to enforce IVM in development projects. CONCLUSION: Integrated management of malaria vectors in Uganda remains an underdeveloped component of malaria control policy. Cooperation between the health and other sectors needs strengthening and funding for MVC increased in order to develop and effectively implement an appropriate IVM policy. Continuous engagement of communities by government as well as monitoring and evaluation of vector control programmes will be crucial for sustaining IVM in the country.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An important prelude to developing strategies to control infectious diseases is a detailed epidemiological evidence platform to target cost-effective interventions and define resource needs. METHODS: A review of published and un-published reports of malaria vector control and parasite prevention in Uganda was conducted for the period 1900-2013. The objective was to provide a perspective as to how epidemiological intelligence was used to design malaria control before and during the global malaria eradication programme (GMEP) and to contrast this with the evidence generated in support of the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative from 1998 to date. RESULTS: During the GMEP era, comprehensive investigations were undertaken on the effectiveness of vector and parasite control such as indoor residual house-spraying (IRS) and mass drug administration (MDA) at different sites in Uganda. Nationwide malariometric surveys were undertaken between 1964 and 1967 to provide a profile of risk, epidemiology and seasonality leading to an evidence-based national cartography of risk to characterize the diversity of malaria transmission in Uganda. At the launch of the RBM initiative in the late 1990s, an equivalent level of evidence was lacking. There was no contemporary national evidence-base for the likely impact of insecticide-treated nets (ITN), no new malariometric data, no new national cartography of malaria risk or any evidence of tailored intervention delivery based on variations in the ecology of malaria risk in Uganda. DISCUSSION: Despite millions of dollars of overseas development assistance over the last ten years in ITN, and more recently the resurrection of the use of IRS, the epidemiological impact of vector control remains uncertain due to an absence of nationwide basic parasite and vector-based field studies. CONCLUSION: Readily available epidemiological data should become the future business model to maximize malaria funding from 2015. Over the next five to ten years, accountability, impact analysis, financial business cases supported by a culture of data use should become the new paradigm by which malaria programmes, governments and their development partners operate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrated vector management (IVM) is the recommended approach for controlling some vector-borne diseases (VBD). In the face of current challenges to disease vector control, IVM is vital to achieve national targets set for VBD control. Though global efforts, especially for combating malaria, now focus on elimination and eradication, IVM remains useful for Uganda which is principally still in the control phase of the malaria continuum. This paper outlines the processes undertaken to consolidate tactical planning and implementation frameworks for IVM in Uganda. CASE DESCRIPTION: The Uganda National Malaria Control Programme with its efforts to implement an IVM approach to vector control was the 'case' for this study. Integrated management of malaria vectors in Uganda remained an underdeveloped component of malaria control policy. In 2012, knowledge and perceptions of malaria vector control policy and IVM were assessed, and recommendations for a specific IVM policy were made. In 2014, a thorough vector control needs assessment (VCNA) was conducted according to WHO recommendations. The findings of the VCNA informed the development of the national IVM strategic guidelines. Information sources for this study included all available data and accessible archived documentary records on VBD control in Uganda. The literature was reviewed and adapted to the local context and translated into the consolidated tactical framework. DISCUSSION: WHO recommends implementation of IVM as the main strategy to vector control and has encouraged member states to adopt the approach. However, many VBD-endemic countries lack IVM policy frameworks to guide implementation of the approach. In Uganda most VBD coexists and could be managed more effectively if done in tandem. In order to successfully control malaria and other VBD and move towards their elimination, the country needs to scale up proven and effective vector control interventions and also learn from the experience of other countries. The IVM strategy is important in consolidating inter-sectoral collaboration and coordination and providing the tactical direction for effective deployment of vector control interventions along the five key elements of the approach and to align them with contemporary epidemiology of VBD in the country. CONCLUSIONS: Uganda has successfully established an evidence-based IVM approach and consolidated strategic planning and operational frameworks for VBD control. However, operating implementation arrangements as outlined in the national strategic guidelines for IVM and managing insecticide resistance, as well as improving vector surveillance, are imperative. In addition, strengthened information, education and communication/behaviour change and communication, collaboration and coordination will be crucial in scaling up and using vector control interventions.},

	abstract = {Malaria continues to be a burden to the healthcare system in Uganda and represents a regional and global health security issue. According to a 2019 WHO report, there are an estimated 18 million reported cases and over 15,000 estimated deaths in Uganda. This is an estimate as the real numbers of cases and deaths that have not been reported are likely to be much higher. 90\% of the current {\textgreater}43 million inhabitants remain at risk of malaria, and it remains the leading cause of death, particularly among children, according to a Target Malaria Report (Kayondo in Target Malaria, Uganda Report, 2021). With an already strained healthcare system, malaria cases continue to comprise between 30 and 50\% of all outpatient services and between 15 and 20\% of hospitalizations. An intelligence–location based, AI machine learning, UAV classifier in an interactive, iOS, intelligent, cell phone, application (app) platform was employed to provide precise georeferenced, ArcGIS classified, real time, imaged, land use land cover (LULC) data of seasonal, georeferenced, sentinel site, malaria mosquito, Anopheles, [gambiae s.l., arabiensis s.s. and funestus s.l.]. breeding sites in an intervention agro-pastureland village site in the Gulu district of Uganda. Thereafter we continued to signature drone map all treated sub-county, entomological, district-level, capture point, intervention sites every 7–14 days to establish if new foci have occurred and treated those habitats. In so doing, we were able to ascertain valuable seasonal, entomological information [e.g., abiotic constraints such as temperature and habitat drying temporal sample frames for swamps/lagoons, transient pools and man-made holes] for optimally real time treating [Macro Seek and Destroy (S\&D) i.e., real time, targeted, drone larviciding] sentinel site, productive, sub-county, district-level, seasonal, aquatic, Anopheline foci [e.g., a sewage pond in a turbid swamp during the rainy season, a puddle less than one meter that contains An. gambiae s.l. larvae along a commercial, pre-flooded, rural farmland road, An. arabiensis s.s. post-harvested tillers etc. We tested the hypothesis that a real time, environmentally friendly, larval habitat alteration [i.e., Macro S\&D] could reduce aquatic, vector, larval, habitat density and blood parasite levels in treated and not suspected malaria patients at an agro-pastureland, malarious, intervention site. Another hypothesis we tested was timely malaria diagnosis and treatment [Micro S\&D] is associated with low population parasitemia and lower malaria incidences. In 31 days, post-Macro S\&D intervention, there was zero vector density, indoor, adult, female, Anopheles count as ascertained by pyrethrum spray catch at the intervention site. After a mean average of 62 days, blood parasite levels revealed a mean 0 count in timely diagnosed suspected and treated malaria patients. Implementing a real time Macro and Micro S\&D intervention tool along with other existing tools [insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) indoor residual spraying of insecticides (Lin et al. in IEEE Int Conf Comput Vis (ICCV) 2017:2999–3007, 2017)] and proper policy measures [i.e., control and the strategies recommended by WHO such as bed-net distribution behavior change interventions including information, education, communication campaigns] in an entomological district-level intervention site can lower seasonal malaria prevalence either through timely modification of aquatic, Anopheles, larval habitats or through precisely targeted larvicide interventions. to achieve them.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most impact prediction of malaria vector control interventions has been based on African vectors. Anopheles albimanus, the main vector in Central America and the Caribbean, has higher intrinsic mortality, is more zoophilic and less likely to rest indoors. Therefore, relative impact among interventions may be different. Prioritizing interventions, in particular for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum from Haiti, should consider local vector characteristics. METHODS: Field bionomics data of An. albimanus from Hispaniola and intervention effect data from southern Mexico were used to parameterize mathematical malaria models. Indoor residual spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and house-screening were analysed by inferring their impact on the vectorial capacity in a difference-equation model. Impact of larval source management (LSM) was assumed linear with coverage. Case management, mass drug administration and vaccination were evaluated by estimating their effects on transmission in a susceptible-infected-susceptible model. Analogous analyses were done for Anopheles gambiae parameterized with data from Tanzania, Benin and Nigeria. RESULTS: While LSM was equally effective against both vectors, impact of ITNs on transmission by An. albimanus was much lower than for An. gambiae. Assuming that people are outside until bedtime, this was similar for the impact of IRS with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or bendiocarb, and impact of IRS was less than that of ITNs. However, assuming people go inside when biting starts, IRS had more impact on An. albimanus than ITNs. While house-screening had less impact than ITNs or IRS on An. gambiae, it had more impact on An. albimanus than ITNs or IRS. The impacts of chemoprevention and chemotherapy were comparable in magnitude to those of strategies against An. albimanus. Chemo-prevention impact increased steeply as coverage approached 100\%, whilst clinical-case management impact saturated because of remaining asymptomatic infections. CONCLUSIONS: House-screening and repellent IRS are potentially highly effective against An. albimanus if people are indoors during the evening. This is consistent with historical impacts of IRS with DDT, which can be largely attributed to excito-repellency. It also supports the idea that housing improvements have played a critical role in malaria control in North America. For elimination planning, impact estimates need to be combined with feasibility and cost-analysis.},

The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15 different mosquito species - including globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika - synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23-29ºC and declining to zero below 9-23ºC and above 32-38ºC. Different traits restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower thermal optima (25-26ºC) while dengue and Zika viruses had the highest (29ºC) thermal optima. We expect warming to increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate adaptation and migration.},

We review approaches used to evaluate and quantify associations between climate and infectious disease incidence, discuss the array of data available to tackle this question, and detail remaining challenges in understanding the implications of climate change for infectious disease incidence.

Moreover the reports published at the time show that plague epidemics in Bombay occurred in fact with a remarkable seasonal pattern every year since 1897 and at least until 1911. So the 1906 epidemic is clearly not a good example of epidemic stopping because the number of susceptible humans has decreased under a threshold, as suggested by Kermack and McKendrick, but an example of epidemic driven by seasonality. We present a seasonal model for the plague in Bombay and compute the type reproduction numbers associated with rats and fleas, thereby extending to periodic models the notion introduced by Roberts and Heesterbeek.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As malaria prevalence declines in many parts of the world due to widescale control efforts and as drug-resistant parasites begin to emerge, a quantitative understanding of human movement is becoming increasingly relevant to malaria control. However, despite its importance, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding human movement, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A quantitative survey of human movement patterns was conducted in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Mali, Burkina Faso, Zambia, and Tanzania, with three to five survey locations chosen in each country. Questions were included on demographic and trip details, malaria risk behaviour, children accompanying travellers, and mobile phone usage to enable phone signal data to be better correlated with movement. A total of 4352 individuals were interviewed and 6411 trips recorded. RESULTS: A cluster analysis of trips highlighted two distinct traveller groups of relevance to malaria transmission: women travelling with children (in all four countries) and youth workers (in Mali). Women travelling with children were more likely to travel to areas of relatively high malaria prevalence in Mali (OR = 4.46, 95\% CI = 3.42-5.83), Burkina Faso (OR = 1.58, 95\% CI = 1.23-1.58), Zambia (OR = 1.50, 95\% CI = 1.20-1.89), and Tanzania (OR = 2.28, 95\% CI = 1.71-3.05) compared to other travellers. They were also more likely to own bed nets in Burkina Faso (OR = 1.77, 95\% CI = 1.25-2.53) and Zambia (OR = 1.74, 95\% CI = 1.34 2.27), and less likely to own a mobile phone in Mali (OR = 0.50, 95\% CI = 0.39-0.65), Burkina Faso (OR = 0.39, 95\% CI = 0.30-0.52), and Zambia (OR = 0.60, 95\% CI = 0.47-0.76). Malian youth workers were more likely to travel to areas of relatively high malaria prevalence (OR = 23, 95\% CI = 17-31) and for longer durations (mean of 70 days cf 21 days, p {\textless} 0.001) compared to other travellers. CONCLUSIONS: Women travelling with children were a remarkably consistent traveller group across all four countries surveyed. They are expected to contribute greatly towards spatial malaria transmission because the children they travel with tend to have high parasite prevalence. Youth workers were a significant traveller group in Mali and are expected to contribute greatly to spatial malaria transmission because their movements correlate with seasonal rains and hence peak mosquito densities. Interventions aimed at interrupting spatial transmission of parasites should consider these traveller groups.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) are widely recommended for the prevention of malaria in endemic regions. Data from human landing catches provide information on the impact of vector control on vector populations. Here, malaria transmission indoors and outdoors, before and after mass deployment of LLINs and IRS in Uganda was compared. METHODS: The study took place in Tororo district, a historically high transmission area where universal LLIN distribution was conducted in November 2013 and May 2017 and 6 rounds of IRS implemented from December 2014 to July 2018. Human landing catches were performed in 8 houses monthly from October 2011 to September 2012 (pre-intervention period) and every 4 weeks from November 2017 to October 2018 (post-intervention period). Mosquitoes were collected outdoors from 18:00 to 22:00 h and indoors from 18:00 to 06:00 h. Female Anopheles were tested for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites and species identification performed using gross dissection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The interventions were associated with a decline in human biting rate from 19.6 to 2.3 female Anopheles mosquitoes per house per night (p {\textless} 0.001) and annual entomological inoculation rate from 129 to 0 infective bites per person per year (p {\textless} 0.001). The proportion of mosquitoes collected outdoors increased from 11.6 to 49.4\% (p {\textless} 0.001). Prior to the interventions the predominant species was Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.), which comprised an estimated 76.7\% of mosquitoes. Following the interventions, the predominant species was Anopheles arabiensis, which comprised 99.5\% of mosquitoes, with almost complete elimination of An. gambiae s.s. (0.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: Mass distribution of LLINs and 6 rounds of IRS dramatically decreased vector density and sporozoite rate resulting in a marked reduction in malaria transmission intensity in a historically high transmission site in Uganda. These changes were accompanied by a shift in vector species from An. gambiae s.s. to An. arabiensis and a relative increase in outdoor biting.},

We found an asymmetrical competitive interaction between adult populations of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus for the sampled sites. Wind speed was negatively associated with the occurrence and abundance of both vectors. Our model predictions show high accuracy (72.9\% to 94.5\%) in validation tests leaving out a random 10\% subset of sites and data since 2017, suggesting a potential for predicting the distribution of the two Aedes vectors.},

We estimate that in 2010 there were 252 (95\% credible interval: 171-353) million cases of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa that active case finding would detect. However, only 34\% (12-86\%) of these cases would be observed through passive case detection. We estimate that the proportion of all cases of clinical malaria that are in under-fives varies from above 60\% at high transmission to below 20\% at low transmission. The focus of some interventions towards young children may need to be reconsidered, and should be informed by the current local transmission intensity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite large reductions in under-5 lower respiratory infection (LRI) mortality in many locations, the pace of progress for LRIs has generally lagged behind that of other childhood infectious diseases. To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates. METHODS: We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years. FINDINGS: In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95\% uncertainty interval 747 286-873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65·4\% decrease, 61·5-68·5) and in mortality rate (from 362·7 deaths [330·1-392·0] per 100 000 children to 118·9 deaths [109·8-128·3] per 100 000 children; 67·2\% decrease, 63·5-70·1). LRI incidence declined globally (32·4\% decrease, 27·2-37·5). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11·4\% decrease, 0·0-24·5), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6·3\% decrease, 6·1-6·3), and reductions in household air pollution (8·4\%, 6·8-9·2). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

	abstract = {Several prototype vaccines against the asexual blood stage of malaria are undergoing preclinical and phase I testing. Although these vaccines have been chosen for their ability to elicit an anti-parasite response, no practical and sensitive clinical trial procedure has been available for measuring their impact on parasite growth. We describe a system that allows parasite growth rates to be measured in volunteers through the incubation period. Two necessary elements of this system are developed: suitable blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum inocula, and a highly sensitive and quantitative assay to measure parasite growth during the incubation period. We infected five nonimmune volunteers with an inoculum as small as 300 parasites and demonstrated that the resultant in vivo asexual parasite growth rates were reproducible at 12-15-fold per cycle. The system allowed the infection to be followed for eight days before treatment without symptoms developing. These findings suggest that it is feasible to directly measure the anti-parasite efficacy of a prototype malaria vaccine in human volunteers without subjecting them to the risk of disease.},

The model also showed that dyserythropoiesis plays an insignificant role in the resulting anaemia. The anaemia occurs before a substantial antibody response to parasites or erythrocytes could be generated.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is an essential human right, recognised in the Sustainable Development Goals as crucial for preventing disease and improving human wellbeing. Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. METHODS: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs. FINDINGS: Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40·0\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 39·4-40·7) to 50·3\% (50·0-50·5), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46·3\% (95\% UI 46·1-46·5) in 2017, compared with 28·7\% (28·5-29·0) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities ({\textgreater}80\%) in 2017. More than 253 000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88·6\% (95\% UI 87·2-89·7) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95\% UI 664-711) of the 1830 (1797-1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76·1\% (95\% UI 71·6-80·7) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53·9\% (50·6-59·6) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

	abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa suffers by far the greatest malaria burden worldwide and is currently undergoing a profound demographic change, with a growing proportion of its population moving to urban areas. Urbanisation is generally expected to reduce malaria transmission; however the disease still persists in African cities, in some cases at higher levels than in nearby rural areas. Objective. This paper aims to collate and analyse risk factors for urban malaria transmission throughout sub-Saharan Africa and to discuss their implications for control. Methods. A systematic search on malaria and urbanisation was carried out focusing on sub-Saharan Africa. Particular interest was taken in vector breeding sites in urban and periurban areas. Results. A variety of urban vector breeding sites were catalogued, the majority of which were artificial, including urban agriculture, tyre tracks, and ditches. Natural breeding sites varied according to location. Low socioeconomic status was a significant risk factor for malaria, often present in peri-urban areas. A worrying trend was seen in the adaptation of malaria vector species to the urban environment. Urban malaria is highly focused and control programs should reflect this. Conclusion. As urbanisation continues and vector species adapt, continued monitoring and control of urban malaria in sub-Saharan Africa is essential.},

Longitudinal data obtained during a four-month period from a daily survey of 200 permanent inhabitants (one month-83 years old) living in a holoendemic area were analyzed in a random-effects logistic regression model to investigate the relationship between the level of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and risk of fever. It was not possible to build a model that described/summarized correctly this relationship by a continuous function. Findings provide evidence for an age-dependent threshold effect of parasitemia on the occurrence of fever. The level of this threshold varied by 2.45 trophozoites per leukocyte, maximum at one year of age, to 0.5 trophozoites per leukocyte, minimum at 60 years of age. When the parasite density of a person crossed the threshold level corresponding to his or her age, the individual's risk of fever was multiplied by 44 (95\% confidence interval = 13.6-144.8). The existence of this threshold effect allows parasite density to be used to distinguish malaria attacks from other causes of fever within an individual and should facilitate the accurate evaluation of the incidence of clinical malaria in highly endemic areas.},

Microsatellite-based analysis of population structure suggests that parasites within the DRC form a homogeneous population. In contrast, sulfadoxine-resistance markers in dihydropteroate synthase show marked spatial structure with ongoing spread of double and triple mutants compared with 2007. These findings suggest that parasites in the DRC remain panmictic despite rapidly spreading antimalarial-resistance mutations.

	abstract = {Macroparasite infections (e.g., helminths) remain a major human health concern. However, assessing transmission dynamics is problematic because the direct observation of macroparasite dispersal among hosts is not possible. We used a novel landscape genetics approach to examine transmission of the human roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides in a small human population in Jiri, Nepal. Unexpectedly, we found significant genetic structuring of parasites, indicating the presence of multiple transmission foci within a small sampling area ( approximately 14 km(2)). We analyzed several epidemiological variables, and found that transmission is spatially autocorrelated around households and that transmission foci are stable over time despite extensive human movement. These results would not have been obtainable via a traditional epidemiological study based on worm counts alone. Our data refute the assumption that a single host population corresponds to a single parasite transmission unit, an assumption implicit in many classic models of macroparasite transmission. Newer models have shown that the metapopulation-like pattern observed in our data can adversely affect targeted control strategies aimed at community-wide impacts. Furthermore, the observed metapopulation structure and local mating patterns generate an excess of homozygotes that can accelerate the spread of recessive traits such as drug resistance. Our study illustrates how molecular analyses complement traditional epidemiological information in providing a better understanding of parasite transmission. Similar landscape genetic approaches in other macroparasite systems will be warranted if an accurate depiction of the transmission process is to be used to inform effective control strategies.},

Malaria is increasingly imported, caused by Plasmodium vivax in settings outside sub-Saharan Africa, and clustered in small geographical areas or clustered demographically into subpopulations, which are often predominantly adult men, with shared social, behavioural, and geographical risk characteristics. The shift in the populations most at risk of malaria raises important questions for malaria-eliminating countries, since traditional control interventions are likely to be less effective. Approaches to elimination need to be aligned with these changes through the development and adoption of novel strategies and methods.

Parasite prevalence in mosquitoes is highly age-dependent, and the unknown age-structure of fluctuating mosquito populations impedes estimation. Here, we simulate mosquito infection dynamics, where mosquito recruitment is modelled seasonally with fractional Brownian noise, and we develop methods for estimating mosquito infection rates. We find that noise introduces bias, but the magnitude of the bias depends on the 'colour' of the noise. Some of these problems can be overcome by increasing the sampling frequency, but estimates of transmission rates (and estimated reductions in transmission) are most accurate and precise if they combine parity, oocyst rates and sporozoite rates. These studies provide a basis for evaluating the adequacy of various entomological sampling procedures for measuring malaria parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes and for evaluating the direct transmission-blocking effects of a vaccine.},

	abstract = {Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa has historically been almost exclusively attributed to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Current diagnostic and surveillance systems in much of sub-Saharan Africa are not designed to identify or report non-Pf human malaria infections accurately, resulting in a dearth of routine epidemiological data about their significance. The high prevalence of Duffy negativity provided a rationale for excluding the possibility of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) transmission. However, review of varied evidence sources including traveller infections, community prevalence surveys, local clinical case reports, entomological and serological studies contradicts this viewpoint. Here, these data reports are weighted in a unified framework to reflect the strength of evidence of indigenous Pv transmission in terms of diagnostic specificity, size of individual reports and corroboration between evidence sources. Direct evidence was reported from 21 of the 47 malaria-endemic countries studied, while 42 countries were attributed with infections of visiting travellers. Overall, moderate to conclusive evidence of transmission was available from 18 countries, distributed across all parts of the continent. Approximately 86.6 million Duffy positive hosts were at risk of infection in Africa in 2015. Analysis of the mechanisms sustaining Pv transmission across this continent of low frequency of susceptible hosts found that reports of Pv prevalence were consistent with transmission being potentially limited to Duffy positive populations. Finally, reports of apparent Duffy-independent transmission are discussed. While Pv is evidently not a major malaria parasite across most of sub-Saharan Africa, the evidence presented here highlights its widespread low-level endemicity. An increased awareness of Pv as a potential malaria parasite, coupled with policy shifts towards species-specific diagnostics and reporting, will allow a robust assessment of the public health significance of Pv, as well as the other neglected non-Pf parasites, which are currently invisible to most public health authorities in Africa, but which can cause severe clinical illness and require specific control interventions.},

	abstract = {Abstract After more than a century of sustained work by mathematicians, biologists, epidemiologists, probabilists, and other experts, dynamic models have become a vital tool for understanding and describing epidemics and disease transmission systems. Such models fulfill a variety of crucial roles including data integration, estimation of disease burden, forecasting trends, counterfactual evaluation, and parameter estimation. These models often incorporate myriad details, from age and social structure to inform population mixing patterns, commuting and migration, and immunological dynamics, among others. This complexity can be daunting, so many researchers have turned to stochastic simulation using agent-based models. Developing agent-based models, however, can present formidable technical challenges. In particular, depending on how the model updates state, unwanted or even unnoticed approximations can be introduced into a simulation model. In this article, we present computational methods for approximating continuous time discrete event stochastic processes based on a discrete time step to speed up complicated simulations which also converges to the true process as the time step goes to zero. Our stochastic models is constructed via hazard functions, and only those hazards which are dependent on the state of other agents (such as infection) are approximated, whereas hazards governing dynamics internal to an agent (such as immune response) are simulated exactly. By partitioning hazards as being either dependent or internal, a generic algorithm can be presented which is applicable to many models of contagion processes, with natural areas of extension and optimization.Author summary Stochastic simulation of epidemics is crucial to a variety of tasks in public health, encompassing intervention evaluation, trend forecasting, and estimation of epidemic parameters, among others. In many situations, due to model complexity, time constraints, unavailability or unfamiliarity with existing software, or other reasons, agent-based models are used to simulate epidemic processes. However, many simulation algorithms are ad hoc, which may introduce unwanted or unnoticed approximations. We present a method to build approximate, agent-based models from mathematical descriptions of stochastic epidemic processes which will improve simulation speed and converge to exact simulation techniques in limiting cases. The simplicity and generality of our method should be widely applicable to various problems in mathematical epidemiology and its connection to other methods developed in chemical physics should inspire future work and elaboration.},

We performed an empirical, non-parametric simulation based on cohort data from Tororo District, Uganda-an area with historically high but recently reduced malaria transmission-to estimate the effects of mass drug administration (MDA) and test-and-treat on parasite prevalence. We estimate that a single round of MDA would have accelerated declines in parasite prevalence dramatically over 2 years (cumulative parasite prevalence ratio [PPR], 0.34). This decline was mostly during the first year of administration (PPR, 0.23) and waned by 23 months (PPR, 0.74). Test-and-treat using a highly sensitive diagnostic had nearly the same effect as MDA at 1 year (PPR, 0.27) and required many fewer treatments. The impact of test-and-treat using a standard diagnostic was modest (PPR, 0.58 at 1 year). Our analysis suggests that in areas experiencing a dramatic reduction in malaria prevalence, MDA or test-and-treat with a highly sensitive diagnostic may be an effective way of reducing or eliminating the infectious reservoir temporarily. However, for sustained benefits, repeated rounds of the intervention or additional interventions are required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many national malaria programmes have set goals of eliminating malaria, but realistic timelines for achieving this goal remain unclear. In this investigation, historical data are collated on countries that successfully eliminated malaria to assess how long elimination has taken in the past, and thus to inform feasible timelines for achieving it in the future. METHODS: Annual malaria case series were sought for 56 successful elimination programmes through a non-systematic review. Up to 40 years of annual case counts were compiled leading up to the first year in which zero locally acquired or indigenous cases were reported. To separate the period over which effective elimination efforts occurred from prior background trends, annual case totals were log transformed, and their slopes evaluated for a breakpoint in linear trend using the segmented package in R. The number of years from the breakpoint to the first year with zero cases and the decline rate over that period were then calculated. Wilcox-Mann-Whitney tests were used to evaluate whether a set of territory characteristics were associated with the timelines and decline rates. RESULTS: Case series declining to the first year with zero cases were compiled for 45/56 of the candidate elimination programmes, and statistically significant breakpoints were identified for 42. The median timeline from the breakpoint to the first year with zero local cases was 12 years, over which cases declined at a median rate of 54\% per year. Prior to the breakpoint, the median trend was slightly decreasing with median annual decline of {\textless} 3\%. Timelines to elimination were fastest among territories that lacked land boundaries, had centroids in the Tropics, received low numbers of imported cases, and had elimination certified by the World Health Organization. CONCLUSION: The historical case series assembled here may help countries with aspirations of malaria elimination to set feasible milestones towards this goal. Setting goals for malaria elimination on short timescales may be most appropriate in isolated, low importation settings, such as islands, while other regions aiming to eliminate malaria must consider how to sustainably fund and maintain vital case management and vector control services until zero cases are reached.},

	abstract = {The Program for Resistance, Immunology, Surveillance, and Modeling of Malaria (PRISM) has been conducting malaria research in Uganda since 2010 to improve the understanding of the disease and measure the impact of population-level control interventions in the country. Here, we will summarize key research findings from a series of studies addressing routine health facility-based surveillance, comprehensive cohort studies, studies of the molecular epidemiology, and transmission of malaria, evaluation of antimalarial drug efficacy, and resistance across the country, and assessments of insecticide resistance. Among our key findings are the following. First, we found that in historically high transmission areas of Uganda, a combination of universal distribution of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs) and sustained indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides lowered the malaria burden greatly, but marked resurgences occurred if IRS was discontinued. Second, submicroscopic infections are common and key drivers of malaria transmission, especially in school-age children (5-15 years). Third, markers of drug resistance have changed over time, with new concerning emergence of markers predicting resistance to artemisinin antimalarials. Fourth, insecticide resistance monitoring has demonstrated high levels of resistance to pyrethroids, appreciable impact of the synergist piperonyl butoxide to pyrethroid susceptibility, emerging resistance to carbamates, and complete susceptibility of malaria vectors to organophosphates, which could have important implications for vector control interventions. Overall, PRISM has yielded a wealth of information informing researchers and policy-makers on the malaria burden and opportunities for improved malaria control and eventual elimination in Uganda. Continued studies concerning all the types of surveillance discussed above are ongoing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are the malaria control interventions primarily responsible for reductions in transmission intensity across sub-Saharan Africa. These interventions, however, may have differential impact on Anopheles species composition and density. This study examined the changing pattern of Anopheles species in three areas of Uganda with markedly different transmission intensities and different levels of vector control. METHODS: From October 2011 to June 2016 mosquitoes were collected monthly using CDC light traps from 100 randomly selected households in three areas: Walukuba (low transmission), Kihihi (moderate transmission) and Nagongera (high transmission). LLINs were distributed in November 2013 in Walukuba and Nagongera and in June 2014 in Kihihi. IRS was implemented only in Nagongera, with three rounds of bendiocarb delivered between December 2014 and June 2015. Mosquito species were identified morphologically and by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). RESULTS: In Walukuba, LLIN distribution was associated with a decline in Anopheles funestus vector density (0.07 vs 0.02 mosquitoes per house per night, density ratio [DR] 0.34, 95\% CI: 0.18-0.65, p = 0.001), but not Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) nor Anopheles arabiensis. In Kihihi, over 98\% of mosquitoes were An. gambiae s.s. and LLIN distribution was associated with a decline in An. gambiae s.s. vector density (4.00 vs 2.46, DR 0.68, 95\% CI: 0.49-0.94, p = 0.02). In Nagongera, the combination of LLINs and multiple rounds of IRS was associated with almost complete elimination of An. gambiae s.s. (28.0 vs 0.17, DR 0.004, 95\% CI: 0.002-0.009, p {\textless} 0.001), and An. funestus sensu lato (s.l.) (3.90 vs 0.006, DR 0.001, 95\% CI: 0.0005-0.004, p {\textless} 0.001), with a less pronounced decline in An. arabiensis (9.18 vs 2.00, DR 0.15 95\% CI: 0.07-0.33, p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LLIN distribution was associated with reductions in An. funestus s.l. in the lowest transmission site and An. gambiae s.s. in the moderate transmission site. In the highest transmission site, a combination of LLINs and multiple rounds of IRS was associated with the near collapse of An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus s.l. Following IRS, An. arabiensis, a behaviourally resilient vector, became the predominant species, which may have implications for malaria vector control activities. Development of interventions targeted at outdoor biting remains a priority.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-resistant genotypes of Plasmodium falciparum have now emerged a minimum of six times on three continents despite recommendations that all artemisinins be deployed as artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). Widespread resistance to the non-artemisinin partner drugs in ACTs has the potential to limit the clinical and resistance benefits provided by combination therapy. We aimed to model and evaluate the long-term effects of high levels of partner-drug resistance on the early emergence of artemisinin-resistant genotypes. METHODS: Using a consensus modelling approach, we used three individual-based mathematical models of Plasmodium falciparum transmission to evaluate the effects of pre-existing partner-drug resistance and ACT deployment on the evolution of artemisinin resistance. Each model simulates 100 000 individuals in a particular transmission setting (malaria prevalence of 1\%, 5\%, 10\%, or 20\%) with a daily time step that updates individuals' infection status, treatment status, immunity, genotype-specific parasite densities, and clinical state. We modelled varying access to antimalarial drugs if febrile (coverage of 20\%, 40\%, or 60\%) with one primary ACT used as first-line therapy: dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), or artemether-lumefantrine (AL). The primary outcome was time until 0·25 580Y allele frequency for artemisinin resistance (the establishment time). FINDINGS: Higher frequencies of pre-existing partner-drug resistant genotypes lead to earlier establishment of artemisinin resistance. Across all models, a 10-fold increase in the frequency of partner-drug resistance genotypes on average corresponded to loss of artemisinin efficacy 2-12 years earlier. Most reductions in time to artemisinin resistance establishment were observed after an increase in frequency of the partner-drug resistance genotype from 0·0 to 0·10. INTERPRETATION: Partner-drug resistance in ACTs facilitates the early emergence of artemisinin resistance and is a major public health concern. Higher-grade partner-drug resistance has the largest effect, with piperaquine resistance accelerating the early emergence of artemisinin-resistant alleles the most. Continued investment in molecular surveillance of partner-drug resistant genotypes to guide choice of first-line ACT is paramount.

This study assessed the contribution of climate to a malaria epidemic in Rwanda, focusing on the catchment area of one health centre where diagnosis was consistent and non-climatic variables well monitored. In late 1987 malaria incidence in the area increased by 337\% over the 3 previous years. The increase was greatest in groups with little acquired immunity–children under 2 years (564\%) and people in high-altitude areas (501\%). Case-fatality rose significantly (relative risk = 4.85, p {\textless} 0.001). 1987 also saw record high temperatures and rainfall. An autoregressive equation including lagged effects of these two variables explained 80\% of the variance in monthly malaria incidence. Temperature (especially mean minimum) predicted incidence best at higher altitudes where malaria had increased most. Empirically derived relations were consistent with the estimated generation time of the disease and with the known sensitivity of the plasmodium parasite to temperature. The patterns of climatic warming between day and night and among seasons will be critical to the effect on malaria. These findings are most relevant to regions near the altitude or latitude limits of the disease, where several epidemics have lately been reported.},

The optimal solution for a single location is to initially release a substantial number of mosquitoes and to subsequently release fewer sterile males proportionally to the decreasing female population. The optimal solution for the whole island is intractable given a constraint on the total daily release of sterile males. The best approximation to the spatial optimal control strategy is to focus on the high mosquito density areas first and then move outwards (in both directions along the periphery of the island), until all areas have been covered, retaining throughout sufficient release intensity to prevent reintroduction in the already cleared areas.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacies of remote symptom-based diagnosis of malaria, rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy in an area of low endemicity in the Philippines. METHODS: In Trial I, 350 symptomatic patients were tested within their villages using malaria Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)/Plasmodium vivax (Pv) immunochromatographic tests (ICT tests) and blood films stored and read under local conditions. The slides were later restained and read. In Trial II, unsupervised volunteer barangay health workers prepared ICT tests and slides after brief training. These slides were read at rural health units. Twenty-seven barangay health workers and 72 community members were later questioned about the three diagnostic strategies. FINDINGS: A history of fever alone was sensitive (95.4\%) but poorly specific (16.5\%) for predicting parasitaemia. The inclusion of other symptoms reduced the sensitivity to below 85\%, while specificity remained low. The axillary temperature was poorly predictive. ICT tests achieved high sensitivity (97.9\%) but many cases indicated as positive by ICT tests were negative by microscopy. Further analysis of these cases in Trial I indicated that ICT tests were detecting low-level parasitaemias missed by microscopy, and that local microscopy had poor accuracy. ICT tests were well accepted and accurately performed by barangay health workers.

Temperature along with other environmental factors at breeding and resting locations play a role in the organismal development and abundance of mosquitoes. Accurate analysis of mosquito population dynamics requires information on microclimatic conditions at breeding and resting locations. In this study, we develop a regression model to characterize microclimatic temperature based on ambient environmental conditions. Data were collected by placing sensor loggers at resting and breeding locations such as storm drains across Houston, TX. Corresponding weather data was obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website. Features extracted from these data sources along with contextual information on location were used to develop a Generalized Linear Model for predicting microclimate temperatures. We also analyzed mosquito population dynamics for Aedes albopictus under ambient and microclimatic conditions using system dynamic (SD) modelling to demonstrate the need for accurate microclimatic temperatures in population models. The microclimate prediction model had an R2 value of 95\% and average prediction error of 1.5 °C indicating that microclimate temperatures can be reliably estimated from the ambient environmental conditions. SD model analysis indicates that some microclimates in Texas could result in larger populations of juvenile and adult Aedes albopictus mosquitoes surviving the winter without requiring dormancy.},

	abstract = {Abstract Water temperature is an important determinant of the growth and development of malaria mosquito immatures. To gain a better understanding of the daily temperature dynamics of malaria mosquito breeding sites and of the relationships between meteorological variables and water temperature, three clear water pools (diameter ? depth: 0·16 ? 0·04, 0·32 ? 0·16 and 0·96 ? 0·32 m) were created in Kenya. Continuous water temperature measurements at various depths were combined with weather data collections from a meteorological station. The water pools were homothermic, but the top water layer differed by up to about 2 °C in temperature, depending on weather conditions. Although the daily mean temperature of all water pools was similar (27·4?28·1 °C), the average recorded difference between the daily minimum and maximum temperature was 14·4 °C in the smallest versus 7·1 °C in the largest water pool. Average water temperature corresponded well with various meteorological variables. The temperature of each water pool was continuously higher than the air temperature. A model was developed that predicts the diurnal water temperature dynamics accurately, based on the estimated energy budget components of these water pools. The air?water interface appeared the most important boundary for energy exchange processes and on average 82?89\% of the total energy was gained and lost at this boundary. Besides energy loss to longwave radiation, loss due to evaporation was high; the average estimated daily evaporation ranged from 4·2 mm in the smallest to 3·7 mm in the largest water pool.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The reasons for malaria resurgence mostly in Africa are yet to be well understood. Although the causes are often linked to regional climate change, it is important to understand the impact of climate variability on the dynamics of the disease. However, this is almost impossible without adequate long-term malaria data over the study areas. METHODS: In this study, we develop a climate-based mosquito-human malaria model to study malaria dynamics in the human population over KwaZulu-Natal, one of the epidemic provinces in South Africa, from 1970-2005. We compare the model output with available observed monthly malaria cases over the province from September 1999 to December 2003. We further use the model outputs to explore the relationship between the climate variables (rainfall and temperature) and malaria incidence over the province using principal component analysis, wavelet power spectrum and wavelet coherence analysis. The model produces a reasonable fit with the observed data and in particular, it captures all the spikes in malaria prevalence. RESULTS: Our results highlight the importance of climate factors on malaria transmission and show the seasonality of malaria epidemics over the province. Results from the principal component analyses further suggest that, there are two principal factors associated with climates variables and the model outputs. One of the factors indicate high loadings on Susceptible, Exposed and Infected human, while the other is more correlated with Susceptible and Recovered humans. However, both factors reveal the inverse correlation between Susceptible-Infected and Susceptible-Recovered humans respectively. Through the spectrum analysis, we notice a strong annual cycle of malaria incidence over the province and ascertain a dominant of one year periodicity. Consequently, our findings indicate that an average of 0 to 120-day lag is generally noted over the study period, but the 120-day lag is more associated with temperature than rainfall. This is consistence with other results obtained from our analyses that malaria transmission is more tightly coupled with temperature than with rainfall in KwaZulu-Natal province.},

Changes in regional climate, due to urbanization and global greenhouse gas concentrations, may affect the ecology of mosquitoes and mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The effects of changes in climate on mosquito population dynamics are complex but critical and urgent for implementing more effective public health policies. This study quantified the impact of urbanization and global climate change on the population of the mosquito species, Culex quinquefasciatus, in the Pearl River Delta region in southern China-an area that has undergone substantial urbanization and is expected to experience changes in climate. This study employed a mechanistic model to simulate mosquito population dynamics under various greenhouse gas emission and land-cover change scenarios based on climate data provided by a state-of-the-art regional climate model. Our results show a 12.6\% decrease in the annual mosquito population in newly urbanized areas and a 5.9\% increase in the annual mosquito population in existing urban areas. Furthermore, changing climate conditions are projected to cause a 15-17\% reduction in the total annual mosquito population; however, the change will not be uniform throughout the year. Peak months exhibit a reduction in population, whereas non-peak months show a significant increase. These findings suggest mosquito control strategies may need to be adjusted to respond to the impacts of urbanization and climate change on mosquito population dynamics to maximize effectiveness. Region specific, quantitative analyses of environmental impacts on mosquito-borne disease ecology, like this study, are needed to provide policy makers with a scientific reference to guide the formation of effective transmission intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many mosquito-borne diseases exhibit substantial seasonality, due to strong links between environmental variables and vector and pathogen life-cycles. Further, a range of density-dependent and density-independent biotic and abiotic processes affect the phenology of mosquito populations, with potentially large knock-on effects for vector dynamics and disease transmission. Whilst it is understood that density-independent and density-dependent processes affect seasonal population levels, it is not clear how these interact temporally to shape the population peaks and troughs. Due to this, the paucity of high-resolution data for validation, and the difficulty of parameterizing density-dependent processes, models of vector dynamics may poorly estimate abundances, which has knock-on effects for our ability predict vector-borne disease outbreaks. RESULTS: We present a rich dataset describing seasonal abundance patterns of each life stage of Culex pipiens, a widespread vector of West Nile virus, at a field site in southern England in 2015. Abundance of immature stages was measured three times per week, whilst adult traps were run four nights each week. This dataset is integrated with an existing delay-differential equation model predicting Cx. pipiens seasonal abundance to improve understanding of observed seasonal abundance patterns. At our field site, the outcome of our model fitting suggests interspecific predation on mosquito larvae and temperature-dependent larval mortality combine to act as the main sources of population regulation throughout the active season, whilst competition for resources is a relatively small source of larval mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests that density-independent mortality and interspecific predation interact to shape patterns of mosquito seasonal abundance in a permanent aquatic habitat and we propose that competition for resources is likely to be important where periods of high rainfall create transient habitats. Further, we highlight the importance of challenging population abundance models with data from across all life stages of the species of interest if reliable inferences are to be drawn from these models, particularly when considering mosquito control and vector-borne disease transmission.},

These cities are located on the edges of the range of the Asian tiger mosquito within the United States of America and were chosen as test cases. We use a disease model that explicitly incorporates mosquito population dynamics and high-resolution climate projections. Based on projected changes under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1fi (higher) and B1 (lower) emission scenarios as simulated by four global climate models, we found that the projected warming shortened mosquito lifespan, which in turn decreased the potential dengue season.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first part of this study aimed to develop a model for Anopheles gambiae s.l. with separate parametrization schemes for Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis. The characterizations were constructed based on literature from the past decades. This part of the study is focusing on the model's ability to separate the mean state of the two species of the An. gambiae complex in Africa. The model is also evaluated with respect to capturing the temporal variability of An. arabiensis in Ethiopia. Before conclusions and guidance based on models can be made, models need to be validated. METHODS: The model used in this paper is described in part one (Malaria Journal 2013, 12:28). For the validation of the model, a data base of 5,935 points on the presence of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis was constructed. An additional 992 points were collected on the presence An. gambiae s.l.. These data were used to assess if the model could recreate the spatial distribution of the two species. The dataset is made available in the public domain. This is followed by a case study from Madagascar where the model's ability to recreate the relative fraction of each species is investigated. In the last section the model's ability to reproduce the temporal variability of An. arabiensis in Ethiopia is tested. The model was compared with data from four papers, and one field survey covering two years. RESULTS: Overall, the model has a realistic representation of seasonal and year to year variability in mosquito densities in Ethiopia. The model is also able to describe the distribution of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis in sub-Saharan Africa. This implies this model can be used for seasonal and long term predictions of changes in the burden of malaria. Before models can be used to improving human health, or guide which interventions are to be applied where, there is a need to understand the system of interest. Validation is an important part of this process. It is also found that one of the main mechanisms separating An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis is the availability of hosts; humans and cattle. Climate play a secondary, but still important, role.},

	abstract = {The release of genetically-modified or sterile male mosquitoes offers a promising form of mosquito-transmitted pathogen control, but the insights derived from our understanding of male mosquito behaviour have not fully been incorporated into the design of such genetic control or sterile-male release methods. The importance of aspects of male life history and mating behaviour for sterile-male release programmes were investigated by projecting a stage-structured matrix model over time. An elasticity analysis of transient dynamics during sterile-male releases was performed to provide insight on which vector control methods are likely to be most synergistic. The results suggest that high mating competitiveness and mortality costs of released males are required before the sterile-release method becomes ineffective. Additionally, if released males suffer a mortality cost, older males should be released due to their increased mating capacity. If released males are of a homogenous size and size-assortative mating occurs in nature, this can lead to an increase in the abundance of large females and reduce the efficacy of the population-suppression effort. At a high level of size-assortative mating, the disease transmission potential of the vector population increases due to male releases, arguing for the release of a heterogeneously-sized male population. The female population was most sensitive to perturbations of density-dependent components of larval mortality and female survivorship and fecundity. These findings suggest source reduction might be a particularly effective complement to mosquito control based on the sterile insect technique (SIT). In order for SIT to realize its potential as a key component of an integrated vector-management strategy to control mosquito-transmitted pathogens, programme design of sterile-male release programmes must account for the ecology, behaviour and life history of mosquitoes. The model used here takes a step in this direction and can easily be modified to investigate additional aspects of mosquito behaviour or species-specific ecology.},

	abstract = {Feeding persistence of mosquitoes (that tendency to attack again within a short period if a first meal is incomplete) is a key determinant of feeding success (defined here as blood-meal volume), especially with regard to mosquitoes that attack defensive hosts. Mortality risk from the vertebrate host is one cost that may be expected to create a trade-off against increased fecundity from second and subsequent meals depending on the availability of blood sources and on the probability of survival until the next gonotrophic cycle. We initially used stochastic simulation models to examine potential trade-offs in fecundity and survival for persistent and nonpersistent lines of mosquitoes that acquire blood from potentially dangerous hosts. In these models, a given strategy, i.e. persistence or the lack thereof, was fixed for the lifetime of the mosquito. Persistent blood feeding paid off relative to nonpersistent mosquitoes when feeding-associated mortality was relatively low to moderate and when the probability of obtaining blood on a given attempt was relatively low. On the other hand, the nonpersistent strategy tended to give relatively higher fecundity when the chances of obtaining blood were high. We also examined the implications of persistence as a feeding strategy for mosquitoes that could exhibit this behaviour in a flexible manner over their lifetime in response to state. We solved for optimal feeding behaviours with a stochastic dynamic programming model set up along similar lines to the simulation model. Results from this approach lend support to the idea that the threshold blood-meal size at which mosquitoes should continue to feed should change relative to the age of the mosquito. The modelling approaches used in this study identified important areas of future study for mosquito blood-feeding behaviour.},

	abstract = {Mosquito biting frequency and meal size are considered to be important parameters in the epidemiology of insect-vectored diseases such as malaria. Because both parameters are likely to depend on the size and energetic state of adult mosquitoes, the present study investigates the effects of body size and energy state on attack behaviours in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Attack rates are measured as well as total time spent before giving up for individual females when provided with an unobtainable human hand (i.e. mosquitoes are dislodged every time that they land). The factorial design considers two body sizes, small and large, as well as three sugar deprivation states, 0, 1 and 2 days. The results reveal a positive effect of size on attack rate and a nonlinear effect of energy state, where mosquitoes of intermediate energy state show lower attack rates than either 2-day food-deprived or nondeprived mosquitoes. Moreover, attack rate is negatively associated with persistence time in nondeprived and 2-day food-deprived Anopheles but is unrelated to persistence time in 1-day food-deprived mosquitoes, Interestingly, although persistence times are generally inversely related to attack rates, they are not significantly influenced by either energetic or size states.},

The spatial burden of each of these diseases has been estimated subnationally across SSA, yet no prior analyses have examined the pattern of their combined burden. Here we synthesise subnational estimates of the burden of LRIs, diarrhoea, and malaria in children under-5 from 2000 to 2017 for 43 sub-Saharan countries. Some units faced a relatively equal burden from each of the three diseases, while others had one or two dominant sources of unit-level burden, with no consistent pattern geographically across the entire subcontinent. Using a subnational counterfactual analysis, we show that nearly 300 million DALYs could have been averted since 2000 by raising all units to their national average. Our findings are directly relevant for decision-makers in determining which and targeting where the most appropriate interventions are for increasing child survival.},

We calculate the basic reproductive number, \$\$R\_0\$\$R0, for this model and show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation at \$\$R\_0=1\$\$R0=1, in common with most epidemiological models. We further show that for some sets of parameter values, this bifurcation can be backward (subcritical). We show with numerical simulations that increasing the relative attractiveness of infectious humans, increases \$\$R\_0\$\$R0but reduces the equilibrium prevalence of infectious humans; decreasing the biting rate of exposed mosquitoes increases \$\$R\_0\$\$R0and the equilibrium prevalence of infectious humans and mosquitoes; and increasing the biting rate of infectious mosquitoes has no impact on \$\$R\_0\$\$R0or the equilibrium prevalence of infectious humans, but decreases the infectious prevalence of infectious mosquitoes. These analyses of a simple malaria model show that common assumptions around the relative attractiveness of infectious humans and the relative biting rates of exposed and infectious mosquitoes can have substantial and counter-intuitive effects on malaria transmission dynamics.},

Optimizing the duration and dosing of treatment to minimize the duration of symptomatic infection and selection pressure for resistance simultaneously has the potential to extend the useful therapeutic life of these valuable life-saving drugs without compromising the interests of individual patients.Here, using mathematical models, we explore the theoretical basis for shorter durations of treatment courses, including a range of ecological dynamics of bacteria that cause infections or colonize hosts as commensals. We find that immunity is an important mediating factor in determining the need for long duration of treatment. When immunity to infection is expected, shorter durations that reduce the selection for resistance without interfering with successful clinical outcome are likely to be supported. Adjusting drug treatment strategies to account for the impact of the differences in the ecological niche occupied by commensal flora relative to invasive bacteria could be effective in delaying the spread of bacterial resistance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of malaria intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). METHODS: In two previous IPTi trials in Ifakara (United Republic of Tanzania) and Manhiça (Mozambique), SP was administered three times to infants before 9 months of age through the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Based on the efficacy results of the intervention and on malaria incidence in the target population, an estimate was made of the number of clinical malaria episodes prevented. This number and an assumed case-fatality rate of 1.57\% were used, in turn, to estimate the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and the number of deaths averted. The cost of the intervention, including start-up and recurrent costs, was then assessed on the basis of these figures. FINDINGS: The cost per clinical episode of malaria averted was US\$ 1.57 (range: US\$ 0.8-4.0) in Ifakara and US\$ 4.73 (range: US\$ 1.7-30.3) in Manhiça; the cost per DALY averted was US\$ 3.7 (range: US\$ 1.6-12.2) in Ifakara and US\$ 11.2 (range: US\$ 3.6-92.0) in Manhiça; and the cost per death averted was US\$ 100.2 (range: US\$ 43.0-330.9) in Ifakara and US\$ 301.1 (range: US\$ 95.6-2498.4) in Manhiça. CONCLUSION: From the health system and societal perspectives, IPTi with SP is expected to produce health improvements in a cost-effective way. From an economic perspective, it offers good value for money for public health programmes.},

Interannual climate variability is an important determinant of epidemics in parts of Africa where climate drives both mosquito vector dynamics and parasite development rates. Hence, skilful seasonal climate forecasts may provide early warning of changes of risk in epidemic-prone regions. Here we discuss the development of a system to forecast probabilities of anomalously high and low malaria incidence with dynamically based, seasonal-timescale, multi-model ensemble predictions of climate, using leading global coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models developed in Europe. This forecast system is successfully applied to the prediction of malaria risk in Botswana, where links between malaria and climate variability are well established, adding up to four months lead time over malaria warnings issued with observed precipitation and having a comparably high level of probabilistic prediction skill. In years in which the forecast probability distribution is different from that of climatology, malaria decision-makers can use this information for improved resource allocation.},

To better understand the multiplicity of malaria transmission, this study examines the distribution of transmission intensity across sub-Saharan Africa, reviews the range of methods used, and explores ecological parameters in selected locations. It builds on an extensive geo-referenced database and uses geographical information systems to highlight transmission patterns, knowledge gaps, trends and changes in methodologies over time, and key differences between land use, population density, climate, and the main mosquito species. The aim is to improve the methods of measuring malaria transmission, to help develop the way forward so that we can better assess the impact of the large-scale intervention programmes, and rapid demographic and environmental change taking place across Africa.},

All four parameters show large case-dependent variation that is mainly attributable to host factors. According to the model, the maximum value of the first wave is controlled mainly by the innate immune response. We used the model to explore the expected effects of vaccines targeting the parasite's asexual blood stages on the basis of what we consider to be the biologically most plausible assumptions concerning the parameter modifications induced by vaccination. According to our simulations, the benefit of antiparasitic vaccination is strongly host dependent and vaccine efficacy at low immunogenicity is much larger against severe disease than against fever.

	abstract = {A new method has been established to define the limits on a spontaneous mutation rate for a gene in Plasmodium falciparum. The method combines mathematical modelling and large-scale in vitro culturing and calculates the difference in mutant frequencies at 2 separate time-points. We measured the mutation rate at 2 positions in the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene of 3D7, a pyrimethamine-sensitive line of P. falciparum. This line was re-cloned and an effectively large population was treated with a selective pyrimethamine concentration of 40 nM. We detected point mutations at codon-46 (TTA to TCA) and codon-108 (AGC to AAC), resulting in serine replacing leucine and asparagine replacing serine respectively in the corresponding gene product. The substitutions caused a decrease in pyrimethamine sensitivity. By mathematical modelling we determined that the mutation rate at a given position in DHFR was low and occurred at less than 2.5 x 10(-9) mutations/DHFR gene/replication. This result has important implications for Plasmodium genetic diversity and antimalarial drug therapy by demonstrating that even with low mutation rates anti-malarial resistance will inevitably arise when mutant alleles are selected under drug pressure.},

	abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) proteins expressed on the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes undergo antigenic variation by switching the gene expressed within a repertoire of approximately 50 var genes per haploid genome. The switching of PfEMP1 plays an important role in the survival and pathogenesis of the parasite. To understand how a parasite switches its var gene expression in human infections, we investigated the composition and change of var gene transcripts during the acute phase of well-defined laboratory-induced P. falciparum infections in naive human hosts. Multiple var transcripts, with the same dominant transcript, were identified in samples collected after three to four asexual-parasite cycles in two volunteers infected with cloned 3D7 P. falciparum via mosquito bites. A major change in composition and frequency of var gene transcripts was observed between the culture used to infect the mosquitoes and the parasites recovered from the infected volunteers. A further change was seen when infected blood from a mosquito-infected volunteer was either passaged to other volunteers or cultured in vitro. The diversity of var transcripts did not increase with time. The results suggest that the switch of var gene expression is reinitiated after mosquito transmission and that var genes may rapidly switch from the first gene expressed after liver stage, but subsequent switching occurs at a much lower rate.},

After the emergence of chloroquine resistance, the risk of malaria death among children 0-9 years old in the three populations was multiplied by 2.1, 2.5 and 5.5, respectively. This is the first study to document malaria mortality at the community level in Africa before and after the emergence of chloroquine resistance.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transmission intensity affects almost all aspects of malaria epidemiology and the impact of malaria on human populations. Maps of transmission intensity are necessary to identify populations at different levels of risk and to evaluate objectively options for disease control. To remain relevant operationally, such maps must be updated frequently. Following the first global effort to map Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity in 2007, this paper describes the generation of a new world map for the year 2010. This analysis is extended to provide the first global estimates of two other metrics of transmission intensity for P. falciparum that underpin contemporary questions in malaria control: the entomological inoculation rate (PfEIR) and the basic reproductive number (PfR). METHODS: Annual parasite incidence data for 13,449 administrative units in 43 endemic countries were sourced to define the spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission in 2010 and 22,212 P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys were used in a model-based geostatistical (MBG) prediction to create a continuous contemporary surface of malaria endemicity within these limits. A suite of transmission models were developed that link PfPR to PfEIR and PfR and these were fitted to field data. These models were combined with the PfPR map to create new global predictions of PfEIR and PfR. All output maps included measured uncertainty. RESULTS: An estimated 1.13 and 1.44 billion people worldwide were at risk of unstable and stable P. falciparum malaria, respectively. The majority of the endemic world was predicted with a median PfEIR of less than one and a median PfRc of less than two. Values of either metric exceeding 10 were almost exclusive to Africa. The uncertainty described in both PfEIR and PfR was substantial in regions of intense transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The year 2010 has a particular significance as an evaluation milestone for malaria global health policy. The maps presented here contribute to a rational basis for control and elimination decisions and can serve as a baseline assessment as the global health community looks ahead to the next series of milestones targeted at 2015.},

Understanding the effect of this control effort is vital to inform future control planning. However, the effect of malaria interventions across the varied epidemiological settings of Africa remains poorly understood owing to the absence of reliable surveillance data and the simplistic approaches underlying current disease estimates. Here we link a large database of malaria field surveys with detailed reconstructions of changing intervention coverage to directly evaluate trends from 2000 to 2015, and quantify the attributable effect of malaria disease control efforts. We found that Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40\% between 2000 and 2015. We estimate that interventions have averted 663 (542-753 credible interval) million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor (68\% of cases averted). Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Increasing access to these interventions, and maintaining their effectiveness in the face of insecticide and drug resistance, should form a cornerstone of post-2015 control strategies.},

	abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a mosquito-transmitted pathogen in a multi-patch Ross-Macdonald malaria model with mobile human hosts, mobile vectors, and a heterogeneous environment. We show the existence of a globally stable steady state, and a threshold that determines whether a pathogen is either absent from all patches, or endemic and present at some level in all patches. Each patch is characterized by a local basic reproduction number, whose value predicts whether the disease is cleared or not when the patch is isolated: patches are known as “demographic sinks” if they have a local basic reproduction number less than one, and hence would clear the disease if isolated; patches with a basic reproduction number above one would sustain endemic infection in isolation, and become “demographic sources” of parasites when connected to other patches. Sources are also considered focal areas of transmission for the larger landscape, as they export excess parasites to other areas and can sustain parasite populations. We show how to determine the various basic reproduction numbers from steady state estimates in the patched network and knowledge of additional model parameters, hereby identifying parasite sources in the process. This is useful in the context of control of the infection on natural landscapes, because a commonly suggested strategy is to target focal areas, in order to make their corresponding basic reproduction numbers less than one, effectively turning them into sinks. We show that this is indeed a successful control strategy-albeit a conservative and possibly expensive one-in case either the human host, or the vector does not move. However, we also show that when both humans and vectors move, this strategy may fail, depending on the specific movement patterns exhibited by hosts and vectors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying human and malaria parasite movements is important for control planning across all transmission intensities. Imported infections can reintroduce infections into areas previously free of infection, maintain 'hotspots' of transmission and import drug resistant strains, challenging national control programmes at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Recent analyses based on mobile phone usage data have provided valuable insights into population and likely parasite movements within countries, but these data are restricted to sub-national analyses, leaving important cross-border movements neglected. METHODS: National census data were used to analyse and model cross-border migration and movement, using East Africa as an example. 'Hotspots' of origin-specific immigrants from neighbouring countries were identified for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Populations of origin-specific migrants were compared to distance from origin country borders and population size at destination, and regression models were developed to quantify and compare differences in migration patterns. Migration data were then combined with existing spatially-referenced malaria data to compare the relative propensity for cross-border malaria movement in the region. RESULTS: The spatial patterns and processes for immigration were different between each origin and destination country pair. Hotspots of immigration, for example, were concentrated close to origin country borders for most immigrants to Tanzania, but for Kenya, a similar pattern was only seen for Tanzanian and Ugandan immigrants. Regression model fits also differed between specific migrant groups, with some migration patterns more dependent on population size at destination and distance travelled than others. With these differences between immigration patterns and processes, and heterogeneous transmission risk in East Africa and the surrounding region, propensities to import malaria infections also likely show substantial variations. CONCLUSION: This was a first attempt to quantify and model cross-border movements relevant to malaria transmission and control. With national census available worldwide, this approach can be translated to construct a cross-border human and malaria movement evidence base for other malaria endemic countries. The outcomes of this study will feed into wider efforts to quantify and model human and malaria movements in endemic regions to facilitate improved intervention planning, resource allocation and collaborative policy decisions.},

Existing models of movement either pertain to overly coarse scales, simulate some aspects of movement but not others, or were designed specifically for populations in developed countries. Here, we propose a generalizable framework for simulating the locations that an individual visits, time allocation across those locations, and population-level variation therein. As a case study, we fit alternative models for each of five aspects of movement (number, distance from home and types of locations visited; frequency and duration of visits) to interview data from 157 residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru. Comparison of alternative models showed that location type and distance from home were significant determinants of the locations that individuals visited and how much time they spent there. We also found that for most locations, residents of two neighbourhoods displayed indistinguishable preferences for visiting locations at various distances, despite differing distributions of locations around those neighbourhoods. Finally, simulated patterns of time allocation matched the interview data in a number of ways, suggesting that our framework constitutes a sound basis for simulating fine-scale movement and for investigating factors that influence it.},

	abstract = {Sustaining elimination of malaria in areas with high receptivity and vulnerability will require effective strategies to prevent reestablishment of local transmission, yet there is a dearth of evidence about this phase. Mauritius offers a uniquely informative history, with elimination of local transmission in 1969, re-emergence in 1975, and second elimination in 1998. Towards this end, Mauritius's elimination and prevention of reintroduction (POR) programs were analyzed via a comprehensive review of literature and government documents, supplemented by program observation and interviews with policy makers and program personnel. The impact of the country's most costly intervention, a passenger screening program, was assessed quantitatively using simulation modeling.On average, Mauritius spent \$4.43 per capita per year (pcpy) during its second elimination campaign from 1982 to 1988. The country currently spends \$2.06 pcpy on its POR program that includes robust surveillance, routine vector control, and prompt and effective treatment and response. Thirty-five percent of POR costs are for a passenger screening program. Modeling suggests that the estimated 14\% of imported malaria infections identified by this program reduces the annual risk of indigenous transmission by approximately 2\%. Of cases missed by the initial passenger screening program, 49\% were estimated to be identified by passive or reactive case detection, leaving an estimated 3.1 unidentified imported infections per 100,000 inhabitants per year.The Mauritius experience indicates that ongoing intervention, strong leadership, and substantial predictable funding are critical to consistently prevent the reestablishment of malaria. Sustained vigilance is critical considering Mauritius's enabling conditions. Although the cost of POR is below that of elimination, annual per capita spending remains at levels that are likely infeasible for countries with lower overall health spending. Countries currently embarking on elimination should quantify and plan for potentially similar POR operations and costs.},

As influenza virus genome sequencing becomes cheaper, faster, and more readily available, the ability to predict pandemic potential from sequence data could transform pandemic influenza risk assessment capabilities. However, the complexities of the relationships between virus genotype and phenotype make such predictions extremely difficult. The integration of experimental work, computational tool development, and analysis of evolutionary pathways, together with refinements to influenza surveillance, has the potential to transform our ability to assess the risks posed to humans by non-human influenza viruses and lead to improved pandemic preparedness and response.},

	abstract = {Malaria eradication involves eliminating malaria from every country where transmission occurs. Current theory suggests that the post-elimination challenges of remaining malaria-free by stopping transmission from imported malaria will have onerous operational and financial requirements. Although resurgent malaria has occurred in a majority of countries that tried but failed to eliminate malaria, a review of resurgence in countries that successfully eliminated finds only four such failures out of 50 successful programmes. Data documenting malaria importation and onwards transmission in these countries suggests malaria transmission potential has declined by more than 50-fold (i.e. more than 98\%) since before elimination. These outcomes suggest that elimination is a surprisingly stable state. Elimination's 'stickiness' must be explained either by eliminating countries starting off qualitatively different from non-eliminating countries or becoming different once elimination was achieved. Countries that successfully eliminated were wealthier and had lower baseline endemicity than those that were unsuccessful, but our analysis shows that those same variables were at best incomplete predictors of the patterns of resurgence. Stability is reinforced by the loss of immunity to disease and by the health system's increasing capacity to control malaria transmission after elimination through routine treatment of cases with antimalarial drugs supplemented by malaria outbreak control. Human travel patterns reinforce these patterns; as malaria recedes, fewer people carry malaria from remote endemic areas to remote areas where transmission potential remains high. Establishment of an international resource with backup capacity to control large outbreaks can make elimination stickier, increase the incentives for countries to eliminate, and ensure steady progress towards global eradication. Although available evidence supports malaria elimination's stickiness at moderate-to-low transmission in areas with well-developed health systems, it is not yet clear if such patterns will hold in all areas. The sticky endpoint changes the projected costs of maintaining elimination and makes it substantially more attractive for countries acting alone, and it makes spatially progressive elimination a sensible strategy for a malaria eradication endgame.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Institutions such as hospitals, prisons, and long-term care facilities have been identified as focal points for the transmission of emerging infections. Cost-effective control of these infections in large populations requires the identification of optimal subpopulations for targeted infection control interventions. Our objective was to quantify and compare the relative impact that individual institutions or subpopulations have on wider population-level outbreaks of emerging pathogens. DESIGN: We describe a simple mathematical model to compute the epidemiologic weight (EW) of an institution or subpopulation. The EW represents the rate at which newly infectious individuals exit the institution under consideration. SETTING: A hypothetical academic tertiary-care hospital (700 beds, 5-day length of stay [LOS]) and prison (3098 inmates, 27-day LOS). PATIENTS: Individuals entering a hospital in-patient prison ward and nonprisoners entering both medical and surgical intensive-care units and those admitted to the general medical and surgical wards. RESULTS: The recent example of the community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemic is used to illustrate the EW calculation. Hospitals and prisons, which often have vastly dissimilar populations sizes and LOSs and might have differing transmission rates, can have comparable EWs and thus contribute equally to an epidemic in the community. CONCLUSIONS: This method highlights the importance of measuring entrance and exit colonization prevalences for the optimal targeting of prevention measures. The EW not only identified superspreader institutions but also ranks them, enabling public health workers to optimize the allocation of resources to places where they are likely to be of most benefit.},

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seventy percent of all nosocomial pathogens are resistant to one or more classes of antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are leading causes of hospital acquired infections, and they have proven difficult to eradicate and control. The spread of resistance is ultimately caused by the use and overuse of antibiotics. Antibiotics are effective medicines when used correctly – as is their purpose. The ability of VRE, MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals to spread is affected by the percentage of people who use antibiotics in a population – the more that antibiotics are used, the quicker resistance to them appears and the faster the resistant strain can spread from person to person. Consequently, the more antibiotics that are used today, the greater the chance antibiotic therapy will fail in the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Temperature suitability for malaria transmission is a useful predictor variable for spatial models of malaria infection prevalence. Existing continental or global models, however, are synoptic in nature and so do not characterize inter-annual variability in seasonal patterns of temperature suitability, reducing their utility for predicting malaria risk. METHODS: A malaria Temperature Suitability Index (TSI) was created by first modeling minimum and maximum air temperature with an eight-day temporal resolution from gap-filled MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime and night-time Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets. An improved version of an existing biological model for malaria temperature suitability was then applied to the resulting temperature information for a 13-year data series. The mechanism underlying this biological model is simulation of emergent mosquito cohorts on a two-hour time-step and tracking of each cohort throughout its life to quantify the impact air temperature has on both mosquito survival and sporozoite development. RESULTS: The results of this research consist of 154 monthly raster surfaces that characterize spatiotemporal patterns in TSI across Africa from April 2000 through December 2012 at a 1 km spatial resolution. Generalized TSI patterns were as expected, with consistently high values in equatorial rain forests, seasonally variable values in tropical savannas (wet and dry) and montane areas, and low values in arid, subtropical regions. Comparisons with synoptic approaches demonstrated the additional information available within the dynamic TSI dataset that is lost in equivalent synoptic products derived from long-term monthly averages. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic TSI dataset presented here provides a new product with far richer spatial and temporal information than any other presently available for Africa. As spatiotemporal malaria modeling endeavors evolve, dynamic predictor variables such as the malaria temperature suitability data developed here will be essential for the rational assessment of changing patterns of malaria risk.},

Typically, population data is obtained using censuses and statistical modeling. More recently, methods using remotely-sensed data have emerged, capable of effectively identifying urbanized areas. Obtaining high accuracy in estimation of population distribution in rural areas remains a very challenging task due to the simultaneous requirements of sufficient sensitivity and resolution to detect very sparse populations through remote sensing as well as reliable performance at a global scale. Here, we present a computer vision method based on machine learning to create population maps from satellite imagery at a global scale, with a spatial sensitivity corresponding to individual buildings and suitable for global deployment. By combining this settlement data with census data, we create population maps with {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde30 meter resolution for 18 countries. We validate our method, and find that the building identification has an average precision and recall of 0.95 and 0.91, respectively and that the population estimates have a standard error of a factor {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde2 or less. Based on our data, we analyze 29 percent of the world population, and show that 99 percent lives within 36 km of the nearest urban cluster. The resulting high-resolution population datasets have applications in infrastructure planning, vaccination campaign planning, disaster response efforts and risk analysis such as high accuracy flood risk analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to show the greatest rates of urbanization over the next 50 years. Urbanization has shown a substantial impact in reducing malaria transmission due to multiple factors, including unfavourable habitats for Anopheles mosquitoes, generally healthier human populations, better access to healthcare, and higher housing standards. Statistical relationships have been explored at global and local scales, but generally only examining the effects of urbanization on single malaria metrics. In this study, associations between multiple measures of urbanization and a variety of malaria metrics were estimated at local scales. METHODS: Cohorts of children and adults from 100 households across each of three contrasting sub-counties of Uganda (Walukuba, Nagongera and Kihihi) were followed for 24 months. Measures of urbanicity included density of surrounding households, vegetation index, satellite-derived night-time lights, land cover, and a composite urbanicity score. Malaria metrics included the household density of mosquitoes (number of female Anopheles mosquitoes captured), parasite prevalence and malaria incidence. Associations between measures of urbanicity and malaria metrics were made using negative binomial and logistic regression models. RESULTS: One site (Walukuba) had significantly higher urbanicity measures compared to the two rural sites. In Walukuba, all individual measures of higher urbanicity were significantly associated with a lower household density of mosquitoes. The higher composite urbanicity score in Walukuba was also associated with a lower household density of mosquitoes (incidence rate ratio = 0.28, 95 \% CI 0.17-0.48, p {\textless} 0.001) and a lower parasite prevalence (odds ratio, OR = 0.44, CI 0.20-0.97, p = 0.04). In one rural site (Kihihi), only a higher density of surrounding households was associated with a lower parasite prevalence (OR = 0.15, CI 0.07-0.34, p {\textless} 0.001). And, in only one rural site (Nagongera) was living where NDVI \${\textbackslash}leq\$0.45 associated with higher incidence of malaria (IRR = 1.35, CI 1.35-1.70, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Urbanicity has been shown previously to lead to a reduction in malaria transmission at large spatial scales. At finer scales, individual household measures of higher urbanicity were associated with lower mosquito densities and parasite prevalence only in the site that was generally characterized as being urban. The approaches outlined here can help better characterize urbanicity at the household level and improve targeting of control interventions.},

We quantified spatial variation in transmission rates associated with human demography and key habitat features. We found that large rivers act as semipermeable barriers, leading to a 7-fold reduction in the local rates of propagation. By combining the spatial distribution of major rivers with long-distance dispersal we were able to account for the observed irregular pattern of disease spread across the state without recourse to direct assessment of host-pathogen populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of “leaving no one behind”. Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. METHODS: We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97·5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. FINDINGS: Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56·7 (IQR 31·9-66·8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86·8, 95\% uncertainty interval 84·6-88·9), Iceland (86·0, 84·1-87·6), and Sweden (85·6, 81·8-87·8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10·9, 9·6-11·9), the Central African Republic (11·0, 8·8-13·8), and Somalia (11·3, 9·5-13·1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60\% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5\% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. INTERPRETATION: GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.

Mapping the global distribution of these vectors and the geographical determinants of their ranges is essential for public health planning. Here we compile the largest contemporary database for both species and pair it with relevant environmental variables predicting their global distribution. We show Aedes distributions to be the widest ever recorded; now extensive in all continents, including North America and Europe. These maps will help define the spatial limits of current autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses.

These challenges are illustrated by using a mathematical model to describe the association between the proportion of pre-erythrocytic or blood-stage parasites eliminated by vaccine-induced immune responses and the proportion of infections prevented. It is hypothesized that due to the requirement for all sporozoites to be eliminated to prevent infection, combining infection-blocking vaccines that confer protection through different biological mechanisms could lead to synergistic combinations of efficacy. Vaccines targeting blood-stage parasites may also combine synergistically if they combine to reduce the parasite multiplication rate to below the threshold of 1.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Considerable declines in malaria have accompanied increased funding for control since the year 2000, but historical failures to maintain gains against the disease underscore the fragility of these successes. Although malaria transmission can be suppressed by effective control measures, in the absence of active intervention malaria will return to an intrinsic equilibrium determined by factors related to ecology, efficiency of mosquito vectors, and socioeconomic characteristics. Understanding where and why resurgence has occurred historically can help current and future malaria control programmes avoid the mistakes of the past. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify historical malaria resurgence events. All suggested causes of these events were categorized according to whether they were related to weakened malaria control programmes, increased potential for malaria transmission, or technical obstacles like resistance. RESULTS: The review identified 75 resurgence events in 61 countries, occurring from the 1930s through the 2000s. Almost all resurgence events (68/75 = 91\%) were attributed at least in part to the weakening of malaria control programmes for a variety of reasons, of which resource constraints were the most common (39/68 = 57\%). Over half of the events (44/75 = 59\%) were attributed in part to increases in the intrinsic potential for malaria transmission, while only 24/75 (32\%) were attributed to vector or drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Given that most malaria resurgences have been linked to weakening of control programmes, there is an urgent need to develop practical solutions to the financial and operational threats to effectively sustaining today's successful malaria control programmes.},

	abstract = {A major issue in the control of malaria is the evolution of drug resistance. Ecological theory has demonstrated that pathogen superinfection and the resulting within-host competition influences the evolution of specific traits. Individuals infected with Plasmodium falciparum are consistently infected by multiple parasites; however, while this probably alters the dynamics of resistance evolution, there are few robust mathematical models examining this issue. We developed a general theory for modelling the evolution of resistance with host superinfection and examine: (i) the effect of transmission intensity on the rate of resistance evolution; (ii) the importance of different biological costs of resistance; and (iii) the best measure of the frequency of resistance. We find that within-host competition retards the ability and slows the rate at which drug-resistant parasites invade, particularly as the transmission rate increases. We also find that biological costs of resistance that reduce transmission are less important than reductions in the duration of drug-resistant infections. Lastly, we find that random sampling of the population for resistant parasites is likely to significantly underestimate the frequency of resistance. Considering superinfection in mathematical models of antimalarial drug resistance may thus be important for generating accurate predictions of interventions to contain resistance.},

A review of malaria transmission in sub-Saharan African cities shows the strong likelihood of transmission occurring within these sprawling cities, whatever the size or characteristics of their bioecologic environment. A meta-analysis of results from studies of malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa shows a loose linear negative relationship between mean annual entomologic inoculation rates (EIR) and the level of urbanicity. Few studies have failed to find entomologic evidence of some transmission. Our results show mean annual EIRs of 7.1 in the city centers, 45.8 in periurban areas, and 167.7 in rural areas. The impact of urbanization in reducing transmission is more marked in areas where the mean rainfall is low and seasonal. Considerable variation in the level of transmission exists among cities and within different districts in the same city. This article presents evidence from past literature to build a conceptual framework to begin to explain this heterogeneity. The potential for malaria epidemics owing to decreasing levels of natural immunity may be offset by negative impacts of urbanization on the larval ecology of anopheline mosquitoes. Malaria control in urban environments may be simpler as a result of urbanization; however, much of what we know about malaria transmission in rural environments might not hold in the urban context.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Temperature is a key determinant of environmental suitability for transmission of human malaria, modulating endemicity in some regions and preventing transmission in others. The spatial modelling of malaria endemicity has become increasingly sophisticated and is now central to the global scale planning, implementation, and monitoring of disease control and regional efforts towards elimination, but existing efforts to model the constraints of temperature on the malaria landscape at these scales have been simplistic. Here, we define an analytical framework to model these constraints appropriately at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, providing a detailed dynamic description that can enhance large scale malaria cartography as a decision-support tool in public health. RESULTS: We defined a dynamic biological model that incorporated the principal mechanisms of temperature dependency in the malaria transmission cycle and used it with fine spatial and temporal resolution temperature data to evaluate time-series of temperature suitability for transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax throughout an average year, quantified using an index proportional to the basic reproductive number. Time-series were calculated for all 1 km resolution land pixels globally and were summarised to create high-resolution maps for each species delineating those regions where temperature precludes transmission throughout the year. Within suitable zones we mapped for each pixel the number of days in which transmission is possible and an integrated measure of the intensity of suitability across the year. The detailed evaluation of temporal suitability dynamics provided by the model is visualised in a series of accompanying animations. CONCLUSIONS: These modelled products, made available freely in the public domain, can support the refined delineation of populations at risk; enhance endemicity mapping by offering a detailed, dynamic, and biologically driven alternative to the ubiquitous empirical incorporation of raw temperature data in geospatial models; and provide a rich spatial and temporal platform for future biological modelling studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Past experience and modelling suggest that, in most cases, mass treatment strategies are not likely to succeed in interrupting Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission. However, this does not preclude their use to reduce disease burden. Mass screening and treatment (MSAT) is preferred to mass drug administration (MDA), as the latter involves massive over-use of drugs. This paper reports simulations of the incremental cost-effectiveness of well-conducted MSAT campaigns as a strategy for P. falciparum malaria disease-burden reduction in settings with varying receptivity (ability of the combined vector population in a setting to transmit disease) and access to case management. METHODS: MSAT incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated in different sub-Saharan African settings using simulation models of the dynamics of malaria and a literature-based MSAT cost estimate. Imported infections were simulated at a rate of two per 1,000 population per annum. These estimates were compared to the ICERs of scaling up case management or insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage in each baseline health system, in the absence of MSAT. RESULTS: MSAT averted most episodes, and resulted in the lowest ICERs, in settings with a moderate level of disease burden. At a low pre-intervention entomological inoculation rate (EIR) of two infectious bites per adult per annum (IBPAPA) MSAT was never more cost-effective than scaling up ITNs or case management coverage. However, at pre-intervention entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) of 20 and 50 IBPAPA and ITN coverage levels of 40 or 60\%, respectively, the ICER of MSAT was similar to that of scaling up ITN coverage further. CONCLUSIONS: In all the transmission settings considered, achieving a minimal level of ITN coverage is a “best buy”. At low transmission, MSAT probably is not worth considering. Instead, MSAT may be suitable at medium to high levels of transmission and at moderate ITN coverage. If undertaken as a burden-reducing intervention, MSAT should be continued indefinitely and should complement, not replace, case management and vector control interventions.},

The International Panel on Climate Change has concluded that there is likely to be a net extension in the distribution of malaria and an increase in incidence within this range. We investigated long-term meteorological trends in four high-altitude sites in East Africa, where increases in malaria have been reported in the past two decades. Here we show that temperature, rainfall, vapour pressure and the number of months suitable for P. falciparum transmission have not changed significantly during the past century or during the period of reported malaria resurgence. A high degree of temporal and spatial variation in the climate of East Africa suggests further that claimed associations between local malaria resurgences and regional changes in climate are overly simplistic.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. METHODS: We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. FINDINGS: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3\% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43\% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95\% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178\% (95\% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210\% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89\%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59\%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. INTERPRETATION: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

	abstract = {Billions of users of mobile phones, social media platforms, and other technologies generate an increasingly large volume of data that has the potential to be leveraged towards solving public health challenges. These and other big data resources tend to be most successful in epidemiological applications when utilized within an appropriate conceptual framework. Here, we demonstrate the importance of assumptions about host mobility in a framework for dynamic modeling of infectious disease spread among districts within a large urban area. Our analysis focused on spatial and temporal variation in the transmission of dengue virus (DENV) during a series of large seasonal epidemics in Lahore, Pakistan during 2011-2014. Similar to many directly transmitted diseases, DENV transmission occurs primarily where people spend time during daytime hours, given that DENV is transmitted by a day-biting mosquito. We inferred spatiotemporal variation in DENV transmission under five different assumptions about mobility patterns among ten districts of Lahore: no movement among districts, movement following patterns of geo-located tweets, movement proportional to district population size, and movement following the commonly used gravity and radiation models. Overall, we found that inferences about spatiotemporal variation in DENV transmission were highly sensitive to this range of assumptions about intra-urban human mobility patterns, although the three assumptions that allowed for a modest degree of intra-urban mobility all performed similarly in key respects. Differing inferences about transmission patterns based on our analysis are significant from an epidemiological perspective, as they have different implications for where control efforts should be targeted and whether conditions for transmission became more or less favorable over time.

Each amøebula possesses a nucleus and nucleolus; and its movements vary in extent and rapidity with the species, but, in the case of birds, never encroach upon the nucleus of the corpuscle. The amøebulæ increase in size; and, as they do so, tend to lose their movements and to accumulate in their ectoplasm certain black granules, the pigment or melanin, which are the product of assimilation of the hæmoglobin of the corpuscle. In from one to several days the parasites reach their highest development within the vertebrate host, and become either (a) sporocytes or (b) gametocytes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Case detection and treatment are critical to malaria control and elimination as infected individuals who do not seek medical care can serve as persistent reservoirs for transmission. METHODS: Household malaria surveys were conducted in two study areas within Southern Province, Zambia in 2007 and 2008. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted approximately five times throughout the year in each of the two study areas. During study visits, adults and caretakers of children were administered a questionnaire and a blood sample was obtained for a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria. These data were used to estimate the proportions of individuals with malaria potentially identified through passive case detection at health care facilities and those potentially identified through reactive case finding. Simulations were performed to extrapolate data from sampled to non-sampled households. Radii of increasing size surrounding households with an index case were examined to determine the proportion of households with an infected individual that would be identified through reactive case detection. RESULTS: In the 2007 high transmission setting, with a parasite prevalence of 23\%, screening neighboring households within 500 meters of an index case could have identified 89\% of all households with an RDT positive resident and 90\% of all RDT positive individuals. In the 2008 low transmission setting, with a parasite prevalence of 8\%, screening neighboring households within 500 meters of a household with an index case could have identified 77\% of all households with an RDT positive resident and 76\% of all RDT positive individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Testing and treating individuals residing within a defined radius from an index case has the potential to be an effective strategy to identify and treat a large proportion of infected individuals who do not seek medical care, although the efficiency of this strategy is likely to decrease with declining parasite prevalence.},

These geographical differences in Plasmodium mating patterns have been linked to the rate of spread of chloroquine resistance CQR, which, according to some measures, has been slower in Tanzania than in PNG. It has been proposed that the former observation explains the latter, although the theoretical argument linking the two is based on limited simulation studies. Taking a more analytical approach here, we first establish the relevant relationship between the coefficient of inbreeding (F, within loci) and the recombination rate r, between loci, defining an 'effective recombination rate', r = r (1-F. We then show that the emergence of multigenic drug resistance can indeed be slowed (or even quickened) by more outcrossing, but only when resistance is determined by two or more genes, none of which independently confers significant protection. The resistance genes should both be initially rare, and subject to low selection pressure. The analysis does not completely discount the hypothesis that inbreeding significantly influences the spread of CQR, but we show that it can only do so under a restrictive set of conditions, and that these conditions are not satisfied by some laboratory and field data. We discuss some of the wider implications of these results for the evolution of multigenic resistance. Drug resistance},

It concludes that we still cannot reliably measure the scale of some important control problems; e.g., there is considerable uncertainty about the basic reproduction number of malaria. The emergence of new concepts such as strain-specific immunity, and a growing emphasis on disease control as distinct from infection control, mean that some quantitative problems are being redefined more quickly than they are being solved. Population biologists have urged exploration of density-dependent processes which may help or hinder new methods of vector control. This brief review of non-linear phenomena such as facilitation and limitation finds little evidence that they will significantly influence, e.g., the introduction of some novel refractory mechanism into a vector population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major gains have been made in reducing malaria transmission in many parts of the world, principally by scaling-up coverage with long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. Historically, choice of vector control intervention has been largely guided by a parameter sensitivity analysis of George Macdonald's theory of vectorial capacity that suggested prioritizing methods that kill adult mosquitoes. While this advice has been highly successful for transmission suppression, there is a need to revisit these arguments as policymakers in certain areas consider which combinations of interventions are required to eliminate malaria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using analytical solutions to updated equations for vectorial capacity we build on previous work to show that, while adult killing methods can be highly effective under many circumstances, other vector control methods are frequently required to fill effective coverage gaps. These can arise due to pre-existing or developing mosquito physiological and behavioral refractoriness but also due to additive changes in the relative importance of different vector species for transmission. Furthermore, the optimal combination of interventions will depend on the operational constraints and costs associated with reaching high coverage levels with each intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Reaching specific policy goals, such as elimination, in defined contexts requires increasingly non-generic advice from modelling. Our results emphasize the importance of measuring baseline epidemiology, intervention coverage, vector ecology and program operational constraints in predicting expected outcomes with different combinations of interventions.},

	abstract = {Malaria transmission intensity is modeled from the starting perspective of individual vector mosquitoes and is expressed directly as the entomologic inoculation rate (EIR). The potential of individual mosquitoes to transmit malaria during their lifetime is presented graphically as a function of their feeding cycle length and survival, human biting preferences, and the parasite sporogonic incubation period. The EIR is then calculated as the product of 1) the potential of individual vectors to transmit malaria during their lifetime, 2) vector emergence rate relative to human population size, and 3) the infectiousness of the human population to vectors. Thus, impacts on more than one of these parameters will amplify each other's effects. The EIRs transmitted by the dominant vector species at four malaria-endemic sites from Papua New Guinea, Tanzania, and Nigeria were predicted using field measurements of these characteristics together with human biting rate and human reservoir infectiousness. This model predicted EIRs (+/- SD) that are 1.13 +/- 0.37 (range = 0.84-1.59) times those measured in the field. For these four sites, mosquito emergence rate and lifetime transmission potential were more important determinants of the EIR than human reservoir infectiousness. This model and the input parameters from the four sites allow the potential impacts of various control measures on malaria transmission intensity to be tested under a range of endemic conditions. The model has potential applications for the development and implementation of transmission control measures and for public health education.},

We sought to understand the spatial spread of this outbreak to optimise the use of the limited available vaccine stock. METHODS: We jointly analysed datasets describing the epidemic of yellow fever, vector suitability, human demography, and mobility in central Africa to understand and predict the spread of yellow fever virus. We used a standard logistic model to infer the district-specific yellow fever virus infection risk during the course of the epidemic in the region. FINDINGS: The early spread of yellow fever virus was characterised by fast exponential growth (doubling time of 5-7 days) and fast spatial expansion (49 districts reported cases after only 3 months) from Luanda, the capital of Angola. Early invasion was positively correlated with high population density (Pearson's r 0·52, 95\% CI 0·34-0·66). The further away locations were from Luanda, the later the date of invasion (Pearson's r 0·60, 95\% CI 0·52-0·66). In a Cox model, we noted that districts with higher population densities also had higher risks of sustained transmission (the hazard ratio for cases ceasing was 0·74, 95\% CI 0·13-0·92 per log-unit increase in the population size of a district). A model that captured human mobility and vector suitability successfully discriminated districts with high risk of invasion from others with a lower risk (area under the curve 0·94, 95\% CI 0·92-0·97). If at the start of the epidemic, sufficient vaccines had been available to target 50 out of 313 districts in the area, our model would have correctly identified 27 (84\%) of the 32 districts that were eventually affected. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show the contributions of ecological and demographic factors to the ongoing spread of the yellow fever outbreak and provide estimates of the areas that could be prioritised for vaccination, although other constraints such as vaccine supply and delivery need to be accounted for before such insights can be translated into policy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efficient allocation of resources to intervene against malaria requires a detailed understanding of the contemporary spatial distribution of malaria risk. It is exactly 40 y since the last global map of malaria endemicity was published. This paper describes the generation of a new world map of Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity for the year 2007. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 8,938 P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys were identified using a variety of exhaustive search strategies. Of these, 7,953 passed strict data fidelity tests for inclusion into a global database of PfPR data, age-standardized to 2-10 y for endemicity mapping. A model-based geostatistical procedure was used to create a continuous surface of malaria endemicity within previously defined stable spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission. These procedures were implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework so that the uncertainty of these predictions could be evaluated robustly. The uncertainty was expressed as the probability of predicting correctly one of three endemicity classes; previously stratified to be an informative guide for malaria control. Population at risk estimates, adjusted for the transmission modifying effects of urbanization in Africa, were then derived with reference to human population surfaces in 2007. Of the 1.38 billion people at risk of stable P. falciparum malaria, 0.69 billion were found in Central and South East Asia (CSE Asia), 0.66 billion in Africa, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia (Africa+), and 0.04 billion in the Americas. All those exposed to stable risk in the Americas were in the lowest endemicity class (PfPR2-10 5 to or = 40\%) areas. High endemicity was widespread in the Africa+ region, where 0.35 billion people are at this level of risk. Most of the rest live at intermediate risk (0.20 billion), with a smaller number (0.11 billion) at low stable risk. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of P. falciparum malaria endemicity are common in Africa. Uniformly low endemic levels are found in the Americas. Low endemicity is also widespread in CSE Asia, but pockets of intermediate and very rarely high transmission remain. There are therefore significant opportunities for malaria control in Africa and for malaria elimination elsewhere. This 2007 global P. falciparum malaria endemicity map is the first of a series with which it will be possible to monitor and evaluate the progress of this intervention process.},

We developed a Bayesian model using data from 102 national surveys, triangulated against delivery data and distribution reports, to generate year-by-year estimates of four ITN coverage indicators. We explored the impact of two potential 'inefficiencies': uneven net distribution among households and rapid rates of net loss from households. We estimated that, in 2013, 21\% (17\%-26\%) of ITNs were over-allocated and this has worsened over time as overall net provision has increased. We estimated that rates of ITN loss from households are more rapid than previously thought, with 50\% lost after 23 (20-28) months. We predict that the current estimate of 920 million additional ITNs required to achieve universal coverage would in reality yield a lower level of coverage (77\% population access). By improving efficiency, however, the 920 million ITNs could yield population access as high as 95\%.},

Using species distribution models, these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa. Vegetation, elevation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship. At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people; however, the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans. Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of EVD in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many of the mosquito species responsible for malaria transmission belong to a sibling complex; a taxonomic group of morphologically identical, closely related species. Sibling species often differ in several important factors that have the potential to impact malaria control, including their geographical distribution, resistance to insecticides, biting and resting locations, and host preference. The aim of this study was to define the geographical distributions of dominant malaria vector sibling species in Africa so these distributions can be coupled with data on key factors such as insecticide resistance to aid more focussed, species-selective vector control. RESULTS: Within the Anopheles gambiae species complex and the Anopheles funestus subgroup, predicted geographical distributions for Anopheles coluzzii, An. gambiae (as now defined) and An. funestus (distinct from the subgroup) have been produced for the first time. Improved predicted geographical distributions for Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles melas and Anopheles merus have been generated based on records that were confirmed using molecular identification methods and a model that addresses issues of sampling bias and past changes to the environment. The data available for insecticide resistance has been evaluated and differences between sibling species are apparent although further analysis is required to elucidate trends in resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Sibling species display important variability in their geographical distributions and the most important malaria vector sibling species in Africa have been mapped here for the first time. This will allow geographical occurrence data to be coupled with species-specific data on important factors for vector control including insecticide resistance. Species-specific data on insecticide resistance is available for the most important malaria vectors in Africa, namely An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii, An. gambiae and An. funestus. Future work to combine these data with the geographical distributions mapped here will allow more focussed and resource-efficient vector control and provide information to greatly improve and inform existing malaria transmission models.},

In many cases, such models generate data sets (“realizations”) each violating the usual assumptions associated with traditional statistical tests of goodness-of-fit, most notably that of independent observations. Monte Carlo hypothesis tests applied to multiple realizations from such models provide appropriate goodness-of-fit tests regardless of within-model peculiarities. The Monte Carlo tests address the question “Do the observed data appear consistent with the model?” in contrast to the usual question “Does the model appear consistent with the observed data?”. In addition, such tests can make use of the same data sets used to draw systemic inference (i.e. the tests require no additional simulation runs). We illustrate the concept using Pearson's chi-square statistic with correlated data. We also consider the behavior of a similar statistic and of “modeling efficiency” in assessing the fit of a simulation model for the spatial spread of raccoon rabies in Connecticut.},

Although results from a pilot implementation suggested that the subsidy was effective in increasing access to high-quality artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), the Global Fund has converted AMFm into a country-driven mechanism whereby individual countries could choose to fund the subsidy from within their country envelopes. Because the initial costs of the subsidy in the pilot countries was higher than expected, countries are also exploring alternatives to a universal subsidy, such as subsidizing only child doses. We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of a child-targeted policy using an age-structured bioeconomic model of malaria from the provider perspective. Because the vast majority of malaria deaths occur in children, targeting children could potentially improve the cost-effectiveness of the subsidy, though it would avert significantly fewer deaths. However, the benefits of a child-targeted subsidy (i.e. deaths averted) are eroded as leakage (i.e. older individuals taking young child-targeted doses) increases, with few of the benefits of a universal subsidy gained (i.e. reductions in overall prevalence). Although potentially more cost-effective, a child-targeted subsidy must contain measures to reduce the possibility of leakage.},

	abstract = {In repeated behaviours such as those of feeding and reproduction, past experiences can inform future behaviour. By altering their behaviour in response to environmental stimuli, insects in highly variable landscapes can tailor their behaviour to their particular environment. In particular, female mosquitoes may benefit from plasticity in their choice of egg-laying site as these sites are often temporally variable and clustered. The opportunity to adapt egg-laying behaviour to past experience also exists for mosquito populations as females typically lay eggs multiple times throughout their lives. Whether experience and age affect egg-laying (or oviposition) behaviour in the mosquito Stegomyia aegypti (=Aedes aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) was assessed using a wind tunnel. Initially, gravid mosquitoes were provided with a cup containing either repellent or well water. After ovipositing in these cups, the mosquitoes were blood-fed and introduced into a wind tunnel. In this wind tunnel, an oviposition cup containing repellent was placed in the immediate vicinity of the gravid mosquitoes. A cup containing well water was placed at the opposite end of the tunnel so that if the females flew across the chamber, they encountered the well water cup, in which they readily laid eggs. Mosquitoes previously exposed to repellent cups became significantly more likely to later lay eggs in repellent cups, suggesting that previous experience with suboptimal oviposition sites informs mosquitoes of the characteristics of nearby oviposition sites. These results provide further evidence that mosquitoes modify behaviour in response to environmental information and are demonstrated in a vector species in which behavioural plasticity may be ecologically and epidemiologically meaningful.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax exacts a significant toll on health worldwide, yet few efforts to date have quantified the extent and temporal trends of its global distribution. Given the challenges associated with the proper diagnosis and treatment of P vivax, national malaria programmes-particularly those pursuing malaria elimination strategies-require up to date assessments of P vivax endemicity and disease impact. This study presents the first global maps of P vivax clinical burden from 2000 to 2017. METHODS: In this spatial and temporal modelling study, we adjusted routine malariometric surveillance data for known biases and used socioeconomic indicators to generate time series of the clinical burden of P vivax. These data informed Bayesian geospatial models, which produced fine-scale predictions of P vivax clinical incidence and infection prevalence over time. Within sub-Saharan Africa, where routine surveillance for P vivax is not standard practice, we combined predicted surfaces of Plasmodium falciparum with country-specific ratios of P vivax to P falciparum. These results were combined with surveillance-based outputs outside of Africa to generate global maps. FINDINGS: We present the first high-resolution maps of P vivax burden. These results are combined with those for P falciparum (published separately) to form the malaria estimates for the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study. The burden of P vivax malaria decreased by 41·6\%, from 24·5 million cases (95\% uncertainty interval 22·5-27·0) in 2000 to 14·3 million cases (13·7-15·0) in 2017. The Americas had a reduction of 56·8\% (47·6-67·0) in total cases since 2000, while South-East Asia recorded declines of 50·5\% (50·3-50·6) and the Western Pacific regions recorded declines of 51·3\% (48·0-55·4). Europe achieved zero P vivax cases during the study period. Nonetheless, rates of decline have stalled in the past five years for many countries, with particular increases noted in regions affected by political and economic instability. INTERPRETATION: Our study highlights important spatial and temporal patterns in the clinical burden and prevalence of P vivax. Amid substantial progress worldwide, plateauing gains and areas of increased burden signal the potential for challenges that are greater than expected on the road to malaria elimination. These results support global monitoring systems and can inform the optimisation of diagnosis and treatment where P vivax has most impact.

	abstract = {We reviewed the use of simple mathematical models to estimate the duration of Plasmodium falciparum infection after transmission has been interrupted. We then fit an exponential decay model to repeated cross-sectional survey data collected from three historical trials of indoor residual spraying against malaria: one from two contiguous districts in Tanzania-Kenya (Pare Taveta) carried out in 1954, the others in West Papua (1953), and the Garki project in northern Nigeria (1972-1973). A cross-sectional analysis of these datasets gave overall estimates of 602 days (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 581-625) for the infection duration in Pare Taveta, 734 days (95\% CI = 645-849) in West Papua, and 1,329 days (95\% CI =1,193-1,499) for Garki. These estimates are much greater than the most widely quoted figures for the duration of untreated P. falciparum infections. Although these may be exaggerated because some reinfections occurred despite intensive vector control, prevalence was still decreasing when all these projects ended. Longitudinal survival analysis of the Garki data gave much shorter estimates of duration (186 days, 95\% CI = 181-191), but effects of imperfect detection of parasites by microscopy severely bias these estimates. Estimates of infection duration for different age groups showed considerable variation but no general age trend. There was also no clear relationship between malaria endemicity and infection duration. Analyses of successive sampling from the same individuals with parasite typing are needed to obtain more reliable estimates of infection duration in endemic areas. Periods of several years may be required to evaluate long-term effects of interventions on malaria prevalence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dengue is a disease that has undergone significant expansion over the past hundred years. Understanding what factors limit the distribution of transmission can be used to predict current and future limits to further dengue expansion. While not the only factor, temperature plays an important role in defining these limits. Previous attempts to analyse the effect of temperature on the geographic distribution of dengue have not considered its dynamic intra-annual and diurnal change and its cumulative effects on mosquito and virus populations. METHODS: Here we expand an existing modelling framework with new temperature-based relationships to model an index proportional to the basic reproductive number of the dengue virus. This model framework is combined with high spatial and temporal resolution global temperature data to model the effects of temperature on Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus persistence and competence for dengue virus transmission. RESULTS: Our model predicted areas where temperature is not expected to permit transmission and/or Aedes persistence throughout the year. By reanalysing existing experimental data our analysis indicates that Ae. albopictus, often considered a minor vector of dengue, has comparable rates of virus dissemination to its primary vector, Ae. aegypti, and when the longer lifespan of Ae. albopictus is considered its competence for dengue virus transmission far exceeds that of Ae. aegypti. CONCLUSIONS: These results can be used to analyse the effects of temperature and other contributing factors on the expansion of dengue or its Aedes vectors. Our finding that Ae. albopictus has a greater capacity for dengue transmission than Ae. aegypti is contrary to current explanations for the comparative rarity of dengue transmission in established Ae. albopictus populations. This suggests that the limited capacity of Ae. albopictus to transmit DENV is more dependent on its ecology than vector competence. The recommendations, which we explicitly outlined here, point to clear targets for entomological investigation.},

	abstract = {We investigated the microbial diversity of biofilms found in dental unit water systems (DUWS) by three methods. The first was microscopic examination by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), acridine orange staining, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Most bacteria present in the biofilm were viable. FISH detected the beta and gamma, but not the alpha, subclasses of Proteobacteria: In the second method, 55 cultivated biofilm isolates were identified with the Biolog system, fatty acid analysis, and 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. Only 16S identified all 55 isolates, which represented 13 genera. The most common organisms, as shown by analyses of 16S rDNA, belonged to the genera Afipia (28\%) and Sphingomonas (16\%). The third method was a culture-independent direct amplification and sequencing of 165 subclones from community biofilm 16S rDNA. This method revealed 40 genera: the most common ones included Leptospira (20\%), Sphingomonas (14\%), Bacillus (7\%), Escherichia (6\%), Geobacter (5\%), and Pseudomonas (5\%). Some of these organisms may be opportunistic pathogens. Our results have demonstrated that a biofilm in a health care setting may harbor a vast diversity of organisms. The results also reflect the limitations of culture-based techniques to detect and identify bacteria. Although this is the greatest diversity reported in DUWS biofilms, other genera may have been missed. Using a technique based on jackknife subsampling, we projected that a 25-fold increase in the number of subclones sequenced would approximately double the number of genera observed, reflecting the richness and high diversity of microbial communities in these biofilms.},

	abstract = {The development of insecticide resistance in African malaria vectors threatens the continued efficacy of important vector control methods that rely on a limited set of insecticides. To understand the operational significance of resistance we require quantitative information about levels of resistance in field populations to the suite of vector control insecticides. Estimation of resistance is complicated by the sparsity of observations in field populations, variation in resistance over time and space at local and regional scales, and cross-resistance between different insecticide types. Using observations of the prevalence of resistance in mosquito species from the Anopheles gambiae complex sampled from 1,183 locations throughout Africa, we applied Bayesian geostatistical models to quantify patterns of covariation in resistance phenotypes across different insecticides. For resistance to the three pyrethroids tested, deltamethrin, permethrin, and λ-cyhalothrin, we found consistent forms of covariation across sub-Saharan Africa and covariation between resistance to these pyrethroids and resistance to DDT. We found no evidence of resistance interactions between carbamate and organophosphate insecticides or between these insecticides and those from other classes. For pyrethroids and DDT we found significant associations between predicted mean resistance and the observed frequency of kdr mutations in the Vgsc gene in field mosquito samples, with DDT showing the strongest association. These results improve our capacity to understand and predict resistance patterns throughout Africa and can guide the development of monitoring strategies.},

Quantitative analysis of such data gives useful information for planning and evaluating disease control interventions, including vaccination. Using a mathematical model, we fitted data on the cumulative number of reported hospitalized cholera cases in Haiti. R(0) varied by department, ranging from 1.06 to 2.63. At a national level, 46\% vaccination coverage would result in an (R(0)) {\textless}1, which would suppress transmission.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measurement of changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). METHODS: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. FINDINGS: The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95\% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years (1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2·3\% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the five lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1\% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. INTERPRETATION: At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs offset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention efforts, and development assistance for health, including financial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Control programmes for high burden countries are tasked with charting effective multi-year strategies for malaria control within significant resource constraints. Synergies between different control tools, in which more than additive benefit accrues from interventions used together, are of interest because they may be used to obtain savings or to maximize health impact per expenditure. One commonly used intervention in sub-Saharan Africa is indoor residual spraying (IRS), typically deployed through a mass campaign. While possible synergies between IRS and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) have been investigated in multiple transmission settings, coordinated synergy between IRS and other mass medical distribution campaigns have not attracted much attention. Recently, a strong timing-dependent synergy between an IRS campaign and a mass drug administration (MDA) was theoretically quantified. These synergistic benefits likely differ across settings depending on transmission intensity and its overall seasonal pattern. METHODS: High coverage interventions are modelled in different transmission environments using two methods: a Ross-Macdonald model variant and openmalaria simulations. The impact of each intervention strategy was measured through its ability to prevent host infections over time, and the effects were compared to the baseline case of deploying interventions in isolation. RESULTS: By modelling IRS and MDA together and varying their deployment times, a strong synergy was found when the administered interventions overlapped. The added benefit of co-timed interventions was robust to differences in the models. In the Ross-Macdonald model, the impact compared was roughly double the sequential interventions in most transmission settings. Openmalaria simulations of this medical control augmentation of an IRS campaign show an even stronger response with the same timing relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The strong synergies found for these control tools between the complementary interventions demonstrate a general feature of effective concurrent campaign-style vector and medical interventions. A mass treatment campaign is normally short-lived, especially in higher transmission settings. When co-timed, the rapid clearing of the host parasite reservoir via chemotherapy is protected from resurgence by the longer duration of the vector control. An effective synchronous treatment campaign has the potential to greatly augment the impact of indoor residual spraying. Mass screening and treatment (MSAT) with highly sensitive rapid diagnostic tests may demonstrate a comparable trend while mass LLIN campaigns may similarly coordinate with MDA/MSAT.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria vaccines based on the 19-kDa region of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1(19)) derived from the 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum are being tested in clinical trials in Africa. Knowledge of the distribution and natural dynamics of vaccine antigen polymorphisms in populations in which malaria vaccines will be tested will guide vaccine design and permit distinction between natural fluctuations in genetic diversity and vaccine-induced selection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using pyrosequencing, six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the nucleotide sequence encoding MSP-1(19) were genotyped from 1,363 malaria infections experienced by 100 children who participated in a prospective cohort study in Mali from 1999 to 2001. The frequencies of 14 MSP-1(19) haplotypes were compared over the course of the malaria transmission season for all three years, in three age groups, and in consecutive infections within individuals. While the frequency of individual MSP-1(19) haplotypes fluctuated, haplotypes corresponding to FVO and FUP strains of P. falciparum (MSP-1(19) haplotypes QKSNGL and EKSNGL, respectively) were most prevalent during three consecutive years and in all age groups with overall prevalences of 46\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 44\%-49\%) and 36\% (95\% CI 34\%-39\%), respectively. The 3D7 haplotype had a lower overall prevalence of 16\% (95\% CI 14\%-18\%). Multiplicity of infection based on MSP-1(19) was higher at the beginning of the transmission season and in the oldest individuals (aged {\textgreater} or =11 y). Three MSP-1(19) haplotypes had a reduced frequency in symptomatic infections compared to asymptomatic infections. Analyses of the dynamics of MSP-1(19) polymorphisms in consecutive infections implicate three polymorphisms (at positions 1691, 1700, and 1701) as being particularly important in determining allele specificity of anti-MSP-1(19) immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Parasites with MSP-1(19) haplotypes different from that of the leading vaccine strain were consistently the most prevalent at a vaccine trial site. If immunity elicited by an MSP-1-based vaccine is allele-specific, a vaccine based on either the FVO or FUP strain might have better initial efficacy at this site. This study, to our knowledge the largest of its kind to date, provides molecular information needed to interpret population responses to MSP-1-based vaccines and suggests that certain MSP-1(19) polymorphisms may be relevant to cross-protective immunity.},

Here we describe the spatial relationship between the location of Anopheles larval sites and human malaria infection in a cohort study of 642 children, aged 1-10-years-old. Our data suggest that proximity to larval sites predict human malaria infection, when homesteads are upwind of larval sites, but not when homesteads are downwind of larval sites. We conclude that following oviposition, female Anophelines fly upwind in search for human hosts and, thus, malaria transmission may be disrupted by targeting vector larval sites in close proximity, and downwind to malaria hotspots.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. METHODS: We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0·5\% and where VR systems were less than 65\% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. FINDINGS: Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28\% in 1970 to a peak of 45\% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86·9 years (95\% UI 86·7-87·2), and for men in Singapore, at 81·3 years (78·8-83·7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. INTERPRETATION: Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

	abstract = {Infectious diseases rarely exhibit simple dynamics. Outbreaks (defined as excess cases beyond response capabilities) have the potential to cause a disproportionately high burden due to overwhelming health care systems. The recommendations of international policy guidelines and research agendas are based on a perceived standardised definition of an outbreak characterised by a prolonged, high-caseload, extra-seasonal surge. In this analysis we apply multiple candidate outbreak definitions to reported dengue case data from Brazil to test this assumption. The methods identify highly heterogeneous outbreak characteristics in terms of frequency, duration and case burden. All definitions identify outbreaks with characteristics that vary over time and space. Further, definitions differ in their timeliness of outbreak onset, and thus may be more or less suitable for early intervention. This raises concerns about the application of current outbreak guidelines for early warning/identification systems. It is clear that quantitatively defining the characteristics of an outbreak is an essential prerequisite for effective reactive response. More work is needed so that definitions of disease outbreaks can take into account the baseline capacities of treatment, surveillance and control. This is essential if outbreak guidelines are to be effective and generalisable across a range of epidemiologically different settings.},

	abstract = {The recent scale-up of malaria interventions, the ensuing reductions in the malaria burden, and reinvigorated discussions about global eradication have led many countries to consider malaria elimination as an alternative to maintaining control measures indefinitely. Evidence-based guidance to help countries weigh their options is thus urgently needed. A quantitative feasibility assessment that balances the epidemiological situation in a region, the strength of the public health system, the resource constraints, and the status of malaria control in neighboring areas can serve as the basis for robust, long-term strategic planning. Such a malaria elimination feasibility assessment was recently prepared for the Minister of Health in Zanzibar. Based on the Zanzibar experience, a framework is proposed along three axes that assess the technical requirements to achieve and maintain elimination, the operational capacity of the malaria programme and the public health system to meet those requirements, and the feasibility of funding the necessary programmes over time. Key quantitative and qualitative metrics related to each component of the assessment are described here along with the process of collecting data and interpreting the results. Although further field testing, validation, and methodological improvements will be required to ensure applicability in different epidemiological settings, the result is a flexible, rational methodology for weighing different strategic options that can be applied in a variety of contexts to establish data-driven strategic plans.},

Serologic assays can potentially produce precise exposure estimates at low cost; however, current approaches based on responses to a few characterized antigens are not designed to estimate exposure in individuals. Pf-specific antibody responses differ by antigen, suggesting that selection of antigens with defined kinetic profiles will improve estimates of Pf exposure. To identify novel serologic biomarkers of malaria exposure, we evaluated responses to 856 Pf antigens by protein microarray in 186 Ugandan children, for whom detailed Pf exposure data were available. Using data-adaptive statistical methods, we identified combinations of antibody responses that maximized information on an individual's recent exposure. Responses to three novel Pf antigens accurately classified whether an individual had been infected within the last 30, 90, or 365 d (cross-validated area under the curve = 0.86-0.93), whereas responses to six antigens accurately estimated an individual's malaria incidence in the prior year. Cross-validated incidence predictions for individuals in different communities provided accurate stratification of exposure between populations and suggest that precise estimates of community exposure can be obtained from sampling a small subset of that community. In addition, serologic incidence predictions from cross-sectional samples characterized heterogeneity within a community similarly to 1 y of continuous passive surveillance. Development of simple ELISA-based assays derived from the successful selection strategy outlined here offers the potential to generate rich epidemiologic surveillance data that will be widely accessible to malaria control programs.},

Mathematical models are an important tool for understanding the potential medical consequences of this increased exposure. We have developed a mathematical model to evaluate factors affecting the prevalence of human commensal AR bacteria that cause opportunistic infections (e.g., enterococci). Our analysis suggests that AAU hastens the appearance of AR bacteria in humans.

The impacts of these interventions, measured as each campaign's ability over time to reduce infections in a community, are found based on the transmission setting, coverage, and their associated durations. These impacts are compared for both interventions and their joint deployment. Synchronous campaigns of IRS deployed with MDA have a cooperative, synergistic effect whose impact exceeds that when the campaigns are deployed in isolation. Simulations with openmalaria, with its more complex model of transmission, are separately performed and show a similar impact enhancement with these interventions. A new, associated analysis yields simple scaling relationships that estimate the dynamical resurgence time, post-intervention, to infection proliferation in a community.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk-outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk-outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk-outcome associations. METHODS: We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017. FINDINGS: In 2017, 34·1 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 33·3-35·0) deaths and 1·21 billion (1·14-1·28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61·0\% (59·6-62·4) of deaths and 48·3\% (46·3-50·2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10·4 million (9·39-11·5) deaths and 218 million (198-237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7·10 million [6·83-7·37] deaths and 182 million [173-193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6·53 million [5·23-8·23] deaths and 171 million [144-201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4·72 million [2·99-6·70] deaths and 148 million [98·6-202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1·43 million [1·36-1·51] deaths and 139 million [131-147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4·9\% (3·3-6·5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23·5\% decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18·6\% increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low. INTERPRETATION: By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax has the widest geographic distribution of the human malaria parasites and nearly 2.5 billion people live at risk of infection. The control of P. vivax in individuals and populations is complicated by its ability to relapse weeks to months after initial infection. Strains of P. vivax from different geographical areas are thought to exhibit varied relapse timings. In tropical regions strains relapse quickly (three to six weeks), whereas those in temperate regions do so more slowly (six to twelve months), but no comprehensive assessment of evidence has been conducted. Here observed patterns of relapse periodicity are used to generate predictions of relapse incidence within geographic regions representative of varying parasite transmission. METHODS: A global review of reports of P. vivax relapse in patients not treated with a radical cure was conducted. Records of time to first P. vivax relapse were positioned by geographic origin relative to expert opinion regions of relapse behaviour and epidemiological zones. Mixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted to determine which geographic classification best described the data, such that a description of the pattern of relapse periodicity within each region could be described. Model outputs of incidence and mean time to relapse were mapped to illustrate the global variation in relapse. RESULTS: Differences in relapse periodicity were best described by a historical geographic classification system used to describe malaria transmission zones based on areas sharing zoological and ecological features. Maps of incidence and time to relapse showed high relapse frequency to be predominant in tropical regions and prolonged relapse in temperate areas. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that relapse periodicity varies systematically by geographic region and are categorized by nine global regions characterized by similar malaria transmission dynamics. This indicates that relapse may be an adaptation evolved to exploit seasonal changes in vector survival and therefore optimize transmission. Geographic patterns in P. vivax relapse are important to clinicians treating individual infections, epidemiologists trying to infer P. vivax burden, and public health officials trying to control and eliminate the disease in human populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Though essential to the development and evaluation of national malaria control programmes, precise enumeration of the clinical illness burden of malaria in endemic countries remains challenging where local surveillance systems are incomplete. Strategies to infer annual incidence rates from parasite prevalence survey compilations have proven effective in the specific case of Plasmodium falciparum, but have yet to be developed for Plasmodium vivax. Moreover, defining the relationship between P. vivax prevalence and clinical incidence may also allow levels of endemicity to be inferred for areas where the information balance is reversed, that is, incident case numbers are more widely gathered than parasite surveys; both applications ultimately facilitating cartographic estimates of P. vivax transmission intensity and its ensuring disease burden. METHODS: A search for active case detection surveys was conducted and the recorded incidence values were matched to local, contemporary parasite rate measures and classified to geographic zones of differing relapse phenotypes. A hierarchical Bayesian model was fitted to these data to quantify the relationship between prevalence and incidence while accounting for variation among relapse zones. RESULTS: The model, fitted with 176 concurrently measured P. vivax incidence and prevalence records, was a linear regression of the logarithm of incidence against the logarithm of age-standardized prevalence. Specific relationships for the six relapse zones where data were available were drawn, as well as a pooled overall relationship. The slope of the curves varied among relapse zones; zones with short predicted time to relapse had steeper slopes than those observed to contain long-latency relapse phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The fitted relationships, along with appropriate uncertainty metrics, allow for estimates of clinical incidence of known confidence to be made from wherever P. vivax prevalence data are available. This is a prerequisite for cartographic-based inferences about the global burden of morbidity due to P. vivax, which will be used to inform control efforts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite great achievements by insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in reducing malaria transmission, it is unlikely these tools will be sufficient to eliminate malaria transmission on their own in many settings today. Fortunately, field experiments indicate that there are many promising vector control interventions that can be used to complement ITNs and/or IRS by targeting a wide range of biological and environmental mosquito resources. The majority of these experiments were performed to test a single vector control intervention in isolation; however, there is growing evidence and consensus that effective vector control with the goal of malaria elimination will require a combination of interventions. METHOD AND FINDINGS: We have developed a model of mosquito population dynamic to describe the mosquito life and feeding cycles and to optimize the impact of vector control intervention combinations at suppressing mosquito populations. The model simulations were performed for the main three malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa, Anopheles gambiae s.s, An. arabiensis and An. funestus. We considered areas having low, moderate and high malaria transmission, corresponding to entomological inoculation rates of 10, 50 and 100 infective bites per person per year, respectively. In all settings, we considered baseline ITN coverage of 50\% or 80\% in addition to a range of other vector control tools to interrupt malaria transmission. The model was used to sweep through parameters space to select the best optimal intervention packages. Sample model simulations indicate that, starting with ITNs at a coverage of 50\% (An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus) or 80\% (An. arabiensis) and adding interventions that do not require human participation (e.g. larviciding at 80\% coverage, endectocide treated cattle at 50\% coverage and attractive toxic sugar baits at 50\% coverage) may be sufficient to suppress all the three species to an extent required to achieve local malaria elimination. CONCLUSION: The Vector Control Optimization Model (VCOM) is a computational tool to predict the impact of combined vector control interventions at the mosquito population level in a range of eco-epidemiological settings. The model predicts specific combinations of vector control tools to achieve local malaria elimination in a range of eco-epidemiological settings and can assist researchers and program decision-makers on the design of experimental or operational research to test vector control interventions. A corresponding graphical user interface is available for national malaria control programs and other end users.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. METHODS: We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined. FINDINGS: Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124·1 million DALYs [95\% UI 111·2 million to 137·0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122·2 million DALYs [110·3 million to 133·3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83·0 million DALYs [78·3 million to 87·7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89·9 million DALYs [80·9 million to 98·2 million]), high body-mass index (64·8 million DALYs [44·4 million to 87·6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63·8 million DALYs [53·2 million to 76·3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9·3\% (6·9-11·6) decline in deaths and a 10·8\% (8·3-13·1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14·9\% (12·7-17·5) of deaths and 6·2\% (3·9-8·7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12·4\% (10·1-14·9) of deaths and 12·4\% (10·1-14·9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27·3\% (24·9-29·7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks. INTERPRETATION: Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted between September 2001 and November 2002 to the medical and surgical ICUs at the University of Maryland Medical System had active surveillance perirectal cultures performed. Samples were concurrently processed for VRE and ESBL-producing bacteria. RESULTS: Of 1,362 patients who had active surveillance cultures on admission, 136 (10\%) were colonized with VRE. Among these, 15 (positive predictive value, 11\%) were co-colonized with ESBL. Among the 1,226 who were VRE negative, 1,209 were also ESBL negative (negative predictive value, 99\%). Among the 1,362 who had active surveillance cultures on admission, 32 (2\%) were colonized with ESBL. Among these, 15 (47\%) were co-colonized with VRE. Of the 32 patients colonized with ESBL, 10 (31\%) had positive clinical cultures for ESBL on the same hospital admission. For these 10 patients, the surveillance cultures were positive an average of 2.7 days earlier than the clinical cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are colonized with VRE can also be co-colonized with other antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as ESBL-producing bacteria. Our study is the first to measure co-colonization rates of VRE and ESBL-producing bacteria. Isolating VRE-colonized patients would isolate 47\% of the ESBL-colonized patients without the need for further testing. Hence, active surveillance for VRE should also theoretically diminish the amount of patient-to-patient transmission of ESBL-producing bacteria.},

	abstract = {Infectious disease epidemics in populations are inherently spatial—infectious agents are spread by contact from an infectious host to a susceptible host nearby.Among-host differences can determine which hosts suffer disease and the population dynamics of infectious disease epidemics.From the perspective of the infectious agent, a host is a habitat patch; among-host differences that are epidemiologically important are related to the concepts of compositional and configurational heterogeneity in landscape ecology. Heterogeneous mixing in epidemiology encompasses factors that determine who comes into contact with whom; it is analogous to configurational heterogeneity in landscape ecology. Other sorts of heterogeneity are analogous to compositional heterogeneity, including among-host differences in the duration of an infection, susceptibility to infection, or the amount of an infectious agent that is dispersed from an infected host. In real epidemics, compositional heterogeneity and configurational heterogeneity can introduce an overwhelming amount of complexity. Mathematical modeling provides a method for understanding epidemic processes and for taming the complexity. The idea of epidemic distance is introduced as a way of comparing and contrasting two different epidemic processes, and it is used to compare and contrast some of the mathematical models used to understand the role of space and spatial heterogeneity in epidemiology. In understanding real epidemics, the notion of parsimony is a guiding principle—heterogeneity should be weighed and ignored whenever possible. Several case studies are presented in which compositional and configurational heterogeneity are shown to be important.},

Such transfer could have severe public health implications in that treatment failures could result. We have followed a risk assessment approach to evaluate policy options for the streptogramin-class of antibiotics: virginiamycin, an animal growth promoter, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, a antibiotic used in humans. Under the assumption that resistance transfer is possible, models project a wide range of outcomes depending mainly on the basic reproductive number (R(0)) that determines the potential for person-to-person transmission. Counter-intuitively, the benefits of a ban on virginiamycin were highest for intermediate values of R(0), and lower for extremely high or low values of R(0).},

In response, cartographic approaches have been developed that link maps of infection prevalence with mathematical relationships to predict the incidence rate of clinical malaria. Microsimulation (or 'agent-based') models represent a powerful new paradigm for defining such relationships; however, differences in model structure and calibration data mean that no consensus yet exists on the optimal form for use in disease-burden estimation. Here we develop a Bayesian statistical procedure combining functional regression-based model emulation with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to calibrate three selected microsimulation models against a purpose-built data set of age-structured prevalence and incidence counts. This allows the generation of ensemble forecasts of the prevalence-incidence relationship stratified by age, transmission seasonality, treatment level and exposure history, from which we predict accelerating returns on investments in large-scale intervention campaigns as transmission and prevalence are progressively reduced.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria prevalence, clinical incidence, treatment, and transmission rates are dynamically interrelated. Prevalence is often considered a measure of malaria transmission, but treatment of clinical malaria reduces prevalence, and consequently also infectiousness to the mosquito vector and onward transmission. The impact of the frequency of treatment on prevalence in a population is generally not considered. This can lead to potential underestimation of malaria exposure in settings with good health systems. Furthermore, these dynamical relationships between prevalence, treatment, and transmission have not generally been taken into account in estimates of burden. METHODS: Using prevalence as an input, estimates of disease incidence and transmission [as the distribution of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR)] for Plasmodium falciparum have now been made for 43 countries in Africa using both empirical relationships (that do not allow for treatment) and OpenMalaria dynamic micro-simulation models (that explicitly include the effects of treatment). For each estimate, prevalence inputs were taken from geo-statistical models fitted for the year 2010 by the Malaria Atlas Project to all available observed prevalence data. National level estimates of the effectiveness of case management in treating clinical attacks were used as inputs to the estimation of both EIR and disease incidence by the dynamic models. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: When coverage of effective treatment is taken into account, higher country level estimates of average EIR and thus higher disease burden, are obtained for a given prevalence level, especially where access to treatment is high, and prevalence relatively low. These methods provide a unified framework for comparison of both the immediate and longer-term impacts of case management and of preventive interventions.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The quantification of parasite movements can provide valuable information for control strategy planning across all transmission intensities. Mobile parasite carrying individuals can instigate transmission in receptive areas, spread drug resistant strains and reduce the effectiveness of control strategies. The identification of mobile demographic groups, their routes of travel and how these movements connect differing transmission zones, potentially enables limited resources for interventions to be efficiently targeted over space, time and populations. METHODS: National population censuses and household surveys provide individual-level migration, travel, and other data relevant for understanding malaria movement patterns. Together with existing spatially referenced malaria data and mathematical models, network analysis techniques were used to quantify the demographics of human and malaria movement patterns in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Movement networks were developed based on connectivity and magnitudes of flow within each country and compared to assess relative differences between regions and demographic groups. Additional malaria-relevant characteristics, such as short-term travel and bed net use, were also examined. RESULTS: Patterns of human and malaria movements varied between demographic groups, within country regions and between countries. Migration rates were highest in 20-30 year olds in all three countries, but when accounting for malaria prevalence, movements in the 10-20 year age group became more important. Different age and sex groups also exhibited substantial variations in terms of the most likely sources, sinks and routes of migration and malaria movement, as well as risk factors for infection, such as short-term travel and bed net use. CONCLUSION: Census and survey data, together with spatially referenced malaria data, GIS and network analysis tools, can be valuable for identifying, mapping and quantifying regional connectivities and the mobility of different demographic groups. Demographically-stratified HPM and malaria movement estimates can provide quantitative evidence to inform the design of more efficient intervention and surveillance strategies that are targeted to specific regions and population groups.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increase in effective malaria control since 2000 has contributed to a decline in global malaria morbidity and mortality. Knowing when and how existing interventions could be combined to maximise their impact on malaria vectors can provide valuable information for national malaria control programs in different malaria endemic settings. Here, we assess the effect of indoor residual spraying on malaria vector densities in a high malaria endemic setting in eastern Uganda as part of a cohort study where the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was high. METHODS: Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled monthly using CDC light traps in 107 households selected randomly. Information on the use of malaria interventions in households was also gathered and recorded via a questionnaire. A Bayesian spatio-temporal model was then used to estimate mosquito densities adjusting for climatic and ecological variables and interventions. RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae (sensu lato) were most abundant (89.1\%; n = 119,008) compared to An. funestus (sensu lato) (10.1\%, n = 13,529). Modelling results suggest that the addition of indoor residual spraying (bendiocarb) in an area with high coverage of permethrin-impregnated LLINs (99\%) was associated with a major decrease in mosquito vector densities. The impact on An. funestus (s.l.) (Rate Ratio 0.1508; 97.5\% CI: 0.0144-0.8495) was twice as great as for An. gambiae (s.l.) (RR 0.5941; 97.5\% CI: 0.1432-0.8577). CONCLUSIONS: High coverage of active ingredients on walls depressed vector populations in intense malaria transmission settings. Sustained use of combined interventions would have a long-term impact on mosquito densities, limiting infectious biting.},

These changes combined with increasingly evident heterogeneities in malaria transmission require innovative vector control strategies in addition to the established practices of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. Integrated vector management will require focal and tailored vector control to achieve malaria elimination. This switch of emphasis from universal coverage to universal coverage plus additional interventions will be reliant on improved entomological monitoring and evaluation. In 2010, the National Institutes for Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) established a network of malaria research centers termed ICEMRs (International Centers for Excellence in Malaria Research) expressly to develop this evidence base in diverse malaria endemic settings. In this article, we contrast the differing ecology and transmission settings across the ICEMR study locations. In South America, Africa, and Asia, vector biologists are already dealing with many of the issues of pushing to elimination such as highly focal transmission, proportionate increase in the importance of outdoor and crepuscular biting, vector species complexity, and “sub patent” vector transmission.},

	abstract = {Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections and an emerging infectious disease. VRE infections were resistant to standard antibiotics until quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD), a streptogramin antibiotic, was approved in 1999 for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections in people. After that decision, the practice of using virginiamycin in agriculture for animal growth promotion came under intense scrutiny. Virginiamycin, another streptogramin, threatens the efficacy of QD in medicine because streptogramin resistance in enterococci associated with food animals may be transferred to E faecium in hospitalised patients. Policy makers face an unavoidable conundrum when assessing risks for pre-emergent pathogens; good policies that prevent or delay adverse outcomes may leave little evidence that they had an effect. To provide a sound basis for policy, we have reviewed the epidemiology of E faecium and streptogramin resistance and present qualitative results from mathematical models. These models are based on simple assumptions consistent with evidence, and they establish reasonable expectations about the population-genetic and population-dynamic processes underlying the emergence of streptogramin-resistant E faecium (SREF). Using the model, we have identified critical aspects of SREF emergence. We conclude that the emergence of SREF is likely to be the result of an interaction between QD use in medicine and the long-term use of virginiamycin for animal growth promotion. Virginiamycin use has created a credible threat to the efficacy of QD by increasing the mobility and frequency of high-level resistance genes. The potential effects are greatest for intermediate rates of human-to-human transmission (R0 approximately equal 1).},

Evidence from the previous global malaria eradication program and more recent transborder control campaigns have shown the importance of accounting for human movement in introducing infections to areas targeted for elimination. Here, census-based migration data were analyzed with network analysis tools, Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission maps, and global population databases to map globally communities of countries linked by relatively high levels of infection movements. The likely principal sources and destinations of imported cases in each region were also mapped. Results indicate that certain groups of countries, such as those in West Africa and central Asia are much more strongly connected by relatively high levels of population and infection movement than others. In contrast, countries such as Ethiopia and Myanmar display significantly greater isolation in terms of likely infection movements in and out. The mapping here of both communities of countries linked by likely higher levels of infection movement, and “natural” migration boundaries that display reduced movement of people and infections between regions has practical utility. These maps can inform the design of malaria elimination strategies by identifying regional communities of countries afforded protection from recolonization by surrounding regions of reduced migration. For more isolated countries, a nationally focused control or elimination program is likely to stand a better chance of success than those receiving high levels of visitors and migrants from high-transmission regions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria control was strengthened in Zambia over the past decade. The two primary interventions for vector control are indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). Using passive malaria surveillance data collected from 2006 to 2011 through the Zambian District Health Information System, the associations between increased coverage with LLINs and IRS and the burden of malaria in Zambia were evaluated. METHODS: National passive malaria surveillance data from 2006 to 2011 were analysed. A district-level, random-effects model with Poisson regression was used to explore the association between malaria cases and coverage with LLINs and IRS. Malaria cases and LLINs and IRS coverage were mapped to visualize spatiotemporal variation in malaria for each year. RESULTS: From 2006-2011, 24.6 million LLINs were distributed and 6.4 million houses were sprayed with insecticide. Coverage with LLINs was not uniformly distributed over the study period and IRS was targeted to central and southern districts where malaria transmission was low. LLIN coverage was associated with a reduction in malaria cases, although an increase in the number of malaria cases was reported in some districts over the study period. A high burden of malaria persisted in north-eastern Zambia, whereas a reduction in the number of reported malaria cases was observed in western and southern Zambia. CONCLUSION: Enhanced and targeted interventions in north-eastern Zambia where the burden of malaria remains high, as well as efforts to sustain low malaria transmission in the south-west, will be necessary for Zambia to achieve the national goal of being malaria free by 2030.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration for elimination of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is recommended by WHO in some settings. We used consensus modelling to understand how to optimise the effects of mass drug administration in areas with low malaria transmission. METHODS: We collaborated with researchers doing field trials to establish a standard intervention scenario and standard transmission setting, and we input these parameters into four previously published models. We then varied the number of rounds of mass drug administration, coverage, duration, timing, importation of infection, and pre-administration transmission levels. The outcome of interest was the percentage reduction in annual mean prevalence of P falciparum parasite rate as measured by PCR in the third year after the final round of mass drug administration. FINDINGS: The models predicted differing magnitude of the effects of mass drug administration, but consensus answers were reached for several factors. Mass drug administration was predicted to reduce transmission over a longer timescale than accounted for by the prophylactic effect alone. Percentage reduction in transmission was predicted to be higher and last longer at lower baseline transmission levels. Reduction in transmission resulting from mass drug administration was predicted to be temporary, and in the absence of scale-up of other interventions, such as vector control, transmission would return to pre-administration levels. The proportion of the population treated in a year was a key determinant of simulated effectiveness, irrespective of whether people are treated through high coverage in a single round or new individuals are reached by implementation of several rounds. Mass drug administration was predicted to be more effective if continued over 2 years rather than 1 year, and if done at the time of year when transmission is lowest. INTERPRETATION: Mass drug administration has the potential to reduce transmission for a limited time, but is not an effective replacement for existing vector control. Unless elimination is achieved, mass drug administration has to be repeated regularly for sustained effect. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

	abstract = {Human movement plays a key role in economies and development, the delivery of services, and the spread of infectious diseases. However, it remains poorly quantified partly because reliable data are often lacking, particularly for low-income countries. The most widely available are migration data from human population censuses, which provide valuable information on relatively long timescale relocations across countries, but do not capture the shorter-scale patterns, trips less than a year, that make up the bulk of human movement. Census-derived migration data may provide valuable proxies for shorter-term movements however, as substantial migration between regions can be indicative of well connected places exhibiting high levels of movement at finer time scales, but this has never been examined in detail. Here, an extensive mobile phone usage data set for Kenya was processed to extract movements between counties in 2009 on weekly, monthly, and annual time scales and compared to data on change in residence from the national census conducted during the same time period. We find that the relative ordering across Kenyan counties for incoming, outgoing and between-county movements shows strong correlations. Moreover, the distributions of trip durations from both sources of data are similar, and a spatial interaction model fit to the data reveals the relationships of different parameters over a range of movement time scales. Significant relationships between census migration data and fine temporal scale movement patterns exist, and results suggest that census data can be used to approximate certain features of movement patterns across multiple temporal scales, extending the utility of census-derived migration data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The serial interval is a fundamentally important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology that has numerous applications to inferring patterns of transmission from case data. Many of these applications are apropos of efforts to eliminate falciparum malaria from locations throughout the world, yet the serial interval for this disease is poorly understood quantitatively. METHODS: To obtain a quantitative estimate of the serial interval for falciparum malaria, the sum of the components of the falciparum malaria transmission cycle was taken based on a combination of mathematical models and empirical data. During this process, a number of factors were identified that account for substantial variability in the serial interval across different contexts. RESULTS: Treatment with anti-malarial drugs roughly halves the serial interval due to an abbreviated period of human infectiousness, seasonality results in different serial intervals at different points in the transmission season, and variability in within-host dynamics results in many individuals whose serial intervals do not follow average behaviour. Furthermore, 24.5 \% of secondary cases presenting clinically did so prior to the primary cases being identified through active detection of infection. CONCLUSIONS: These results have important implications for epidemiological applications that rely on quantitative estimates of the serial interval of falciparum malaria and other diseases characterized by prolonged infections and complex ecological drivers.},

By using national data on hospitalizations and antibiotic resistance, we estimated the magnitude and trends in annual S. aureus and MRSA hospitalization rates from 2005-2009 by patient age, infection type, and resistance phenotype (CA-MRSA vs. HA-MRSA). Although no statistically significant increase in the hospitalization rate was seen over the study period, the total number of infections increased. In 2009, there were an estimated 463,017 (95\% confidence interval: 441,595, 484,439) MRSA-related hospitalizations at a rate of 11.74 (95\% confidence interval: 11.20, 12.28) per 1,000 hospitalizations. We observed significant differences in infection type by age, with HA-MRSA-related hospitalizations being more common in older individuals. We also noted significant seasonality in incidence, particularly in children, with CA-MRSA peaking in the late summer and HA-MRSA peaking in the winter, which may be caused by seasonal shifts in antibiotic prescribing patterns.},

	abstract = {The 1950 Malaria Conference in Equatorial Africa, held in Kampala, Uganda, has been remembered primarily for its decision to control malaria '...by modern methods as soon as feasible, whatever the original degree of endemicity, and without awaiting the outcome of further experiments.' This decision was far from conclusive and, indeed, reflects only one side of the argument which brought two groups of malariologists into direct opposition on the wisdom of malaria control in equatorial Africa, using modern methods such as DDT. Through an examination of the unpublished verbatim transcript of the Kampala Conference, we are able to document the 'furious debates' which took place at Kampala in 1950. We highlight, in particular, the adamant concerns expressed by some of the delegates that intervention in areas of high malaria transmission might lead to a loss of naturally acquired immunity which, in turn, could give rise to a resurgence of malaria, should the control strategies fail to be sustained. As we show, this concern had been expressed by a number of malariologists working in East Africa in the first half of the twentieth century, but it was only with the advent of DDT, as a residual insecticide, that the implications of wide-spread control, in the absence of any knowledge of the long-term consequences, became a serious possibility. While the Kampala Conference gave the 'go ahead' to control malaria in Africa without awaiting the outcome of 'further experiments', a number of participants insisted that a field trial should be set up to evaluate the impact of malaria on areas of high transmission both before and after spraying: to this end, a field trial in Pare-Taveta was carried out in 1954-59. In this paper we look at the Kampala Conference for its scientific debates and the Pare-Taveta Scheme for its field applications. In the final part of the paper, we address a number of questions raised at Kampala which have, once more, become contentious issues, following the recent successful trials of ITBNs. We believe that an understanding of the historical foundations of these issues should provide an important component of the new WHO campaign to Roll Back Malaria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current understanding of the spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution of Plasmodium vivax is far less developed than that for P. falciparum, representing a barrier to rational strategies for control and elimination. Here we present the first systematic effort to map the global endemicity of this hitherto neglected parasite. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: We first updated to the year 2010 our earlier estimate of the geographical limits of P. vivax transmission. Within areas of stable transmission, an assembly of 9,970 geopositioned P. vivax parasite rate (PvPR) surveys collected from 1985 to 2010 were used with a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach to estimate endemicity age-standardised to the 1-99 year age range (PvPR(1-99)) within every 5\${\textbackslash}times\$5 km resolution grid square. The model incorporated data on Duffy negative phenotype frequency to suppress endemicity predictions, particularly in Africa. Endemicity was predicted within a relatively narrow range throughout the endemic world, with the point estimate rarely exceeding 7\% PvPR(1-99). The Americas contributed 22\% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission, but high endemic areas were generally sparsely populated and the region contributed only 6\% of the 2.5 billion people at risk (PAR) globally. In Africa, Duffy negativity meant stable transmission was constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5\% of global PAR. Central Asia was home to 82\% of global PAR with important high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations particularly in India and Myanmar. South East Asia contained areas of the highest endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and contributed 9\% of global PAR. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This detailed depiction of spatially varying endemicity is intended to contribute to a much-needed paradigm shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination.},

	abstract = {During the last 50 years, the geographic range of the mosquito Aedes aegypti has increased dramatically, in parallel with a sharp increase in the disease burden from the viruses it transmits, including Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. There is a growing consensus that vector control is essential to prevent Aedes-borne diseases, even as effective vaccines become available. What remains unclear is how effective vector control is across broad operational scales because the data and the analytical tools necessary to isolate the effect of vector-oriented interventions have not been available. We developed a statistical framework to model Ae. aegypti abundance over space and time and applied it to explore the impact of citywide vector control conducted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Iquitos, Peru, over a 12-year period. Citywide interventions involved multiple rounds of intradomicile insecticide space spray over large portions of urban Iquitos (up to 40\% of all residences) in response to dengue outbreaks. Our model captured significant levels of spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal variation in Ae. aegypti abundance within and between years and across the city. We estimated the shape of the relationship between the coverage of neighborhood-level vector control and reductions in female Ae. aegypti abundance; i.e., the dose-response curve. The dose-response curve, with its associated uncertainties, can be used to gauge the necessary spraying effort required to achieve a desired effect and is a critical tool currently absent from vector control programs. We found that with complete neighborhood coverage MoH intra-domicile space spray would decrease Ae. aegypti abundance on average by 67\% in the treated neighborhood. Our framework can be directly translated to other interventions in other locations with geolocated mosquito abundance data. Results from our analysis can be used to inform future vector-control applications in Ae. aegypti endemic areas globally.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pathogen transmission by mosquitos is known to be highly sensitive to mosquito bionomic parameters. Mosquito mark-release-recapture (MMRR) experiments are a standard method for estimating such parameters including dispersal, population size and density, survival, blood feeding frequency and blood meal host preferences. METHODS: We assembled a comprehensive database describing adult female MMRR experiments. Bibliographic searches were used to build a digital library of MMRR studies and selected data describing the reported outcomes were extracted. RESULTS: The resulting database contained 774 unique adult female MMRR experiments involving 58 vector mosquito species from the three main genera of importance to human health: Aedes, Anopheles and Culex. Crude examination of these data revealed patterns associated with geography as well as mosquito genus, consistent with bionomics varying by species-specific life history and ecological context. Recapture success varied considerably and was significantly different amongst genera, with 8, 4 and 1\% of adult females recaptured for Aedes, Anopheles and Culex species, respectively. A large proportion of experiments (59\%) investigated dispersal and survival and many allowed disaggregation of the release and recapture data. Geographic coverage was limited to just 143 localities around the world. CONCLUSIONS: This MMRR database is a substantial contribution to the compilation of global data that can be used to better inform basic research and public health interventions, to identify and fill knowledge gaps and to enrich theory and evidence-based ecological and epidemiological studies of mosquito vectors, pathogen transmission and disease prevention. The database revealed limited geographic coverage and a relative scarcity of information for vector species of substantial public health relevance. It represents, however, a wealth of entomological information not previously compiled and of particular interest for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As Swaziland progresses towards national malaria elimination, the importation of parasites into receptive areas becomes increasingly important. Imported infections have the potential to instigate local transmission and sustain local parasite reservoirs. METHODS: Travel histories from Swaziland's routine surveillance data from January 2010 to June 2014 were extracted and analysed. The travel patterns and demographics of rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-confirmed positive cases identified through passive and reactive case detection (RACD) were analysed and compared to those found to be negative through RACD. RESULTS: Of 1517 confirmed cases identified through passive surveillance, 67\% reported travel history. A large proportion of positive cases reported domestic or international travel history (65\%) compared to negative cases (10\%). The primary risk factor for malaria infection in Swaziland was shown to be travel, more specifically international travel to Mozambique by 25- to 44-year old males, who spent on average 28 nights away. Maputo City, Inhambane and Gaza districts were the most likely travel destinations in Mozambique, and 96\% of RDT-positive international travellers were either Swazi (52\%) or Mozambican (44\%) nationals, with Swazis being more likely to test negative. All international travellers were unlikely to have a bed net at home or use protection of any type while travelling. Additionally, paths of transmission, important border crossings and means of transport were identified. CONCLUSION: Results from this analysis can be used to direct national and well as cross-border targeting of interventions, over space, time and by sub-population. The results also highlight that collaboration between neighbouring countries is needed to tackle the importation of malaria at the regional level.},

	abstract = {Prophylactic vaccination is a powerful tool for reducing the burden of infectious diseases, due to a combination of direct protection of vaccinees and indirect protection of others via herd immunity. Computational models play an important role in devising strategies for vaccination by making projections of its impacts on public health. Such projections are subject to uncertainty about numerous factors, however. For example, many vaccine efficacy trials focus on measuring protection against disease rather than protection against infection, leaving the extent of breakthrough infections (i.e., disease ameliorated but infection unimpeded) among vaccinees unknown. Our goal in this study was to quantify the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections results in uncertainty about vaccination impact, with a focus on vaccines for dengue. To realistically account for the many forms of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, which could have implications for the dynamics of indirect protection, we used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission informed by more than a decade of empirical studies in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year-old children at 80\% coverage, projections of the proportion of disease episodes averted varied by a factor of 1.76 (95\% CI: 1.54-2.06) across the range of uncertainty about breakthrough infections. This was equivalent to the range of vaccination impact projected across a range of uncertainty about vaccine efficacy of 0.268 (95\% CI: 0.210-0.329). Until uncertainty about breakthrough infections can be addressed empirically, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for it in models of vaccination impact.},

	abstract = {Vaccine efficacy (VE) estimates are crucial for assessing the suitability of dengue vaccine candidates for public health implementation, but efficacy trials are subject to a known bias to estimate VE toward the null if heterogeneous exposure is not accounted for in the analysis of trial data. In light of many well-characterized sources of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, our goal was to estimate the potential magnitude of this bias in VE estimates for a hypothetical dengue vaccine. To ensure that we realistically modeled heterogeneous exposure, we simulated city-wide DENV transmission and vaccine trial protocols using an agent-based model calibrated with entomological and epidemiological data from long-term field studies in Iquitos, Peru. By simulating a vaccine with a true VE of 0.8 in 1,000 replicate trials each designed to attain 90\% power, we found that conventional methods underestimated VE by as much as 21\% due to heterogeneous exposure. Accounting for the number of exposures in the vaccine and placebo arms eliminated this bias completely, and the more realistic option of including a frailty term to model exposure as a random effect reduced this bias partially. We also discovered a distinct bias in VE estimates away from the null due to lower detectability of primary DENV infections among seronegative individuals in the vaccinated group. This difference in detectability resulted from our assumption that primary infections in vaccinees who are seronegative at baseline resemble secondary infections, which experience a shorter window of detectable viremia due to a quicker immune response. This resulted in an artefactual finding that VE estimates for the seronegative group were approximately 1\% greater than for the seropositive group. Simulation models of vaccine trials that account for these factors can be used to anticipate the extent of bias in field trials and to aid in their interpretation.},

Here, we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: How long one lives, how many years of life are spent in good and poor health, and how the population's state of health and leading causes of disability change over time all have implications for policy, planning, and provision of services. We comparatively assessed the patterns and trends of healthy life expectancy (HALE), which quantifies the number of years of life expected to be lived in good health, and the complementary measure of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a composite measure of disease burden capturing both premature mortality and prevalence and severity of ill health, for 359 diseases and injuries for 195 countries and territories over the past 28 years. METHODS: We used data for age-specific mortality rates, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality, and years lived with disability (YLDs) from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to calculate HALE and DALYs from 1990 to 2017. We calculated HALE using age-specific mortality rates and YLDs per capita for each location, age, sex, and year. We calculated DALYs for 359 causes as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We assessed how observed HALE and DALYs differed by country and sex from expected trends based on Socio-demographic Index (SDI). We also analysed HALE by decomposing years of life gained into years spent in good health and in poor health, between 1990 and 2017, and extra years lived by females compared with males. FINDINGS: Globally, from 1990 to 2017, life expectancy at birth increased by 7·4 years (95\% uncertainty interval 7·1-7·8), from 65·6 years (65·3-65·8) in 1990 to 73·0 years (72·7-73·3) in 2017. The increase in years of life varied from 5·1 years (5·0-5·3) in high SDI countries to 12·0 years (11·3-12·8) in low SDI countries. Of the additional years of life expected at birth, 26·3\% (20·1-33·1) were expected to be spent in poor health in high SDI countries compared with 11·7\% (8·8-15·1) in low-middle SDI countries. HALE at birth increased by 6·3 years (5·9-6·7), from 57·0 years (54·6-59·1) in 1990 to 63·3 years (60·5-65·7) in 2017. The increase varied from 3·8 years (3·4-4·1) in high SDI countries to 10·5 years (9·8-11·2) in low SDI countries. Even larger variations in HALE than these were observed between countries, ranging from 1·0 year (0·4-1·7) in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (62·4 years [59·9-64·7] in 1990 to 63·5 years [60·9-65·8] in 2017) to 23·7 years (21·9-25·6) in Eritrea (30·7 years [28·9-32·2] in 1990 to 54·4 years [51·5-57·1] in 2017). In most countries, the increase in HALE was smaller than the increase in overall life expectancy, indicating more years lived in poor health. In 180 of 195 countries and territories, females were expected to live longer than males in 2017, with extra years lived varying from 1·4 years (0·6-2·3) in Algeria to 11·9 years (10·9-12·9) in Ukraine. Of the extra years gained, the proportion spent in poor health varied largely across countries, with less than 20\% of additional years spent in poor health in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, and Slovakia, whereas in Bahrain all the extra years were spent in poor health. In 2017, the highest estimate of HALE at birth was in Singapore for both females (75·8 years [72·4-78·7]) and males (72·6 years [69·8-75·0]) and the lowest estimates were in Central African Republic (47·0 years [43·7-50·2] for females and 42·8 years [40·1-45·6] for males). Globally, in 2017, the five leading causes of DALYs were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Between 1990 and 2017, age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 41·3\% (38·8-43·5) for communicable diseases and by 49·8\% (47·9-51·6) for neonatal disorders. For non-communicable diseases, global DALYs increased by 40·1\% (36·8-43·0), although age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 18·1\% (16·0-20·2). INTERPRETATION: With increasing life expectancy in most countries, the question of whether the additional years of life gained are spent in good health or poor health has been increasingly relevant because of the potential policy implications, such as health-care provisions and extending retirement ages. In some locations, a large proportion of those additional years are spent in poor health. Large inequalities in HALE and disease burden exist across countries in different SDI quintiles and between sexes. The burden of disabling conditions has serious implications for health system planning and health-related expenditures. Despite the progress made in reducing the burden of communicable diseases and neonatal disorders in low SDI countries, the speed of this progress could be increased by scaling up proven interventions. The global trends among non-communicable diseases indicate that more effort is needed to maximise HALE, such as risk prevention and attention to upstream determinants of health.

In the Fall 2009 issue of Resources magazine, authors David L. Smith and Andrew J. Tatem explore how malaria became a forgotten disease and what leaders in Africa and across the world are doing to eradicate malaria once and for all.Learning from past mistakes, say Smith and Tatem, is important in the fight against malaria. But the world had changed since its last strong effort to combat the disease. With information becoming more widely available through vast databases and projects such as the Malaria Atlas Project, the authors believe that defeating the disease is possible. Mathematical modeling in conjunction with such maps helps to answer basic questions such as what coverage levels are required to eliminate malaria and how long will it take? A strategic, effective plan, according to the authors, will be solidly grounded in malaria epidemiology and economics. “For malaria eradication to succeed, what is needed is a strategic plan that builds on past efforts,” Smith and Tatum write. “Knowing the history of malaria efforts merely keeps us from repeating past mistakes. A truly effective plan must be based on a combination of good medical intelligence and careful and quantitative logic.”},

	abstract = {Our ability to treat common bacterial infections with antibiotics goes back only 65 years. However, the authors of this report make it clear that sustaining a supply of effective and affordable antibiotics cannot be without changes to the incentives facing patients, physicians, hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In fact, increasing resistance to these drugs is already exacting a terrible price. Every day in the United States, approximately 172 men, women, and children die from infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals alone. Beyond those deaths, antibiotic resistance is costing billions of dollars through prolonged hospital stays and the need for doctors to resort to ever more costly drugs to use as substitute treatments. Extending the Cure presents the problem of antibiotic resistance as a conflict between individual decision makers and their short-term interest and the interest of society as a whole, in both present and future: The effort that doctors make to please each patient by prescribing a drug when it might not be properly indicated, poor monitoring of discharged patients to ensure that they do not transmit drug-resistant pathogens to other persons, excesses in the marketing of new antibiotics, and the broad overuse of antibiotics all contribute to the development and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The book explores a range of policy options that would encourage patients, health care providers, and managed care organizations to serve as more responsible stewards of existing antibiotics as well as proposals that would give pharmaceutical firms greater incentives to develop new antibiotics and avoid overselling. If the problem continues unaddressed, antibiotic resistance has the potential to derail the health care system and return us to a world where people of all ages routinely die from simple infections. As a basis for future research and a spur to a critically important dialogue, Extending the Cure is a fundamental first step in addressing this public health crisis. The Extending the Cure project is funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its Pioneer Portfolio.},

Several modelling studies have attempted to predict the future global distribution of dengue. However, the resulting projections are difficult to compare and are sometimes contradictory because the models differ in their approach, in the quality of the disease data that they use and in the choice of variables that drive disease distribution. In this Review, we compare the main approaches that have been used to model the future global distribution of dengue and propose a set of minimum criteria for future projections that, by analogy, are applicable to other vector-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Europe once had widespread malaria, but today it is free from endemic transmission. Changing land use, agricultural practices, housing quality, urbanization, climate change, and improved healthcare are among the many factors thought to have played a role in the declines of malaria seen, but their effects and relative contributions have rarely been quantified. METHODS: Spatial datasets on changes in climate, wealth, life expectancy, urbanization, and land use trends over the past century were combined with datasets depicting the reduction in malaria transmission across 31 European countries, and the relationships were explored. Moreover, the conditions in current malaria-eliminating countries were compared with those in Europe at the time of declining transmission and elimination to assess similarities. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Indicators relating to socio-economic improvements such as wealth, life expectancy and urbanization were strongly correlated with the decline of malaria in Europe, whereas those describing climatic and land use changes showed weaker relationships. Present-day malaria-elimination countries have now arrived at similar socio-economic indicator levels as European countries at the time malaria elimination was achieved, offering hope for achievement of sustainable elimination.},

	abstract = {As malaria declines in parts of Africa and elsewhere, and as more countries move towards elimination, it is necessary to robustly evaluate the effect of interventions and control programmes on malaria transmission. To help guide the appropriate design of trials to evaluate transmission-reducing interventions, we review 11 metrics of malaria transmission, discussing their accuracy, precision, collection methods and costs and presenting an overall critique. We also review the nonlinear scaling relationships between five metrics of malaria transmission: the entomological inoculation rate, force of infection, sporozoite rate, parasite rate and the basic reproductive number, R0. Our chapter highlights that while the entomological inoculation rate is widely considered the gold standard metric of malaria transmission and may be necessary for measuring changes in transmission in highly endemic areas, it has limited precision and accuracy and more standardised methods for its collection are required. In areas of low transmission, parasite rate, seroconversion rates and molecular metrics including MOI and mFOI may be most appropriate. When assessing a specific intervention, the most relevant effects will be detected by examining the metrics most directly affected by that intervention. Future work should aim to better quantify the precision and accuracy of malaria metrics and to improve methods for their collection.},

	abstract = {The quantitative analysis of pathogen transmission within its specific spatial context should improve our ability to predict and control the epizootic spread of that disease. We compared two methods for calibrating the effect of local, spatially distributed environmental heterogeneities on disease spread. Using the time-of-first-appearance of raccoon rabies across the 169 townships in Connecticut, we estimated local spatial variation in township-to-township transmission rate using Trend Surface Analysis (TSA) and then compared these estimates with those based on an earlier probabilistic simulation using the same data. Both the probabilistic simulation and the TSA reveal significant reduction in transmission when local spatial domains are separated by rivers. The probabilistic simulation suggested that township-to-township transmission was reduced sevenfold for townships separated by a river. The global effect of this sevenfold reduction is to increase the time-to-first-appearance in the eastern townships of Connecticut by approximately 29.7\% (spread was from west to east). TSA revealed a similar effect of rivers with an overall reduction in rate of local propagation due to rivers of approximately 22\%. The 7.7\% difference in these two estimates reveals slightly different aspects of the spatial dynamics of this epizootic. Together, these two methods can be used to construct an overall picture of the combined effects of local spatial variation in township-to-township transmission on patterns of local rate of propagation at scales larger than the immediate nearest neighboring townships.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vector-borne diseases cause a significant proportion of the overall burden of disease across the globe, accounting for over 10 \% of the burden of infectious diseases. Despite the availability of effective interventions for many of these diseases, a lack of resources prevents their effective control. Many existing vector control interventions are known to be effective against multiple diseases, so combining vector control programmes to simultaneously tackle several diseases could offer more cost-effective and therefore sustainable disease reductions. DISCUSSION: The highly successful cross-disease integration of vaccine and mass drug administration programmes in low-resource settings acts a precedent for cross-disease vector control. Whilst deliberate implementation of vector control programmes across multiple diseases has yet to be trialled on a large scale, a number of examples of 'accidental' cross-disease vector control suggest the potential of such an approach. Combining contemporary high-resolution global maps of the major vector-borne pathogens enables us to quantify overlap in their distributions and to estimate the populations jointly at risk of multiple diseases. Such an analysis shows that over 80 \% of the global population live in regions of the world at risk from one vector-borne disease, and more than half the world's population live in areas where at least two different vector-borne diseases pose a threat to health. Combining information on co-endemicity with an assessment of the overlap of vector control methods effective against these diseases allows us to highlight opportunities for such integration. Malaria, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, and dengue are prime candidates for combined vector control. All four of these diseases overlap considerably in their distributions and there is a growing body of evidence for the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets, screens, and curtains for controlling all of their vectors. The real-world effectiveness of cross-disease vector control programmes can only be evaluated by large-scale trials, but there is clear evidence of the potential of such an approach to enable greater overall health benefit using the limited funds available.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria is endemic in 13 of 64 districts in Bangladesh. About 14 million people are at risk. Some evidence suggests that the prevalence of malaria in Bangladesh has decreased since the the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria started to support the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) in 2007. We did an epidemiological and economic assessment of malaria control in Bangladesh. METHODS: We obtained annually reported, district-level aggregated malaria case data and information about disbursed funds from the NMCP. We used a Poisson regression model to examine the associations between total malaria, severe malaria, malaria-attributable mortality, and insecticide-treated net coverage. We identified and mapped malaria hotspots using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the NMCP by estimating the cost per confirmed case, cost per treated case, and cost per person of insecticide-treated net coverage. FINDINGS: During the study period (from Jan 1, 2008, to Dec 31, 2012) there were 285,731 confirmed malaria cases. Malaria decreased from 6.2 cases per 1000 population in 2008, to 2.1 cases per 1000 population in 2012. Prevalence of all malaria decreased by 65\% (95\% CI 65-66), severe malaria decreased by 79\% (78-80), and malaria-associated mortality decreased by 91\% (83-95). By 2012, there was one insecticide-treated net for every 2.6 individuals (SD 0.20). Districts with more than 0.5 insecticide-treated nets per person had a decrease in prevalence of 21\% (95\% CI 19-23) for all malaria, 25\% (17-32) for severe malaria, and 76\% (35-91) for malaria-associated mortality among all age groups. Malaria hotspots remained in the highly endemic districts in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The cost per diagnosed case was US\$0.39 (SD 0.02) and per treated case was \$0.51 (0.27); \$0.05 (0.04) was invested per person per year for health education and \$0.68 (0.30) was spent per person per year for insecticide-treated net coverage. INTERPRETATION: Malaria elimination is an achievable prospect in Bangladesh and failure to push for elimination nearly ensures a resurgence of disease. Consistent financing is needed to avoid resurgence and maintain elimination goals. FUNDING: None.},

To understand the population dynamics and community ecology of root hemiparasitic plants and their hosts, models of resource-based competition have been extended to include resource parasitism. Parasitism provides a mechanism for parasitic plants to overcome deficits in their ability to compete for soil resources. The interaction ranges from competitive to exploiter-victim, depending on whether the benefits of parasitism overshadow the costs of competition. These models predict that as productivity in the system increases, parasitic plants should become more abundant. In diverse host communities, differences in the impact that parasites have on their hosts and the benefits that they receive from parasitizing different hosts may lead to nontransitive competitive relationships and a sort of apparent competition. The possible dynamics include paper-rock-scissors oscillations and indirect mutualisms between parasitic plants and their hosts that allow them to form coalitions that can exclude competitive dominants.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. METHODS: We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). FINDINGS: Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 40·8-75·9 million [7·2\%, 6·0-8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0-62·8 million [5·6\%, 4·0-7·2]), 36·3 million (25·3-50·9 million [4·5\%, 3·8-5·3]), 34·7 million (23·0-49·6 million [4·3\%, 3·5-5·2]), and 34·1 million (23·5-46·0 million [4·2\%, 3·2-5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7\% (95\% UI 2·3-3·1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10·4\% (95\% UI 9·0-11·8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95\% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228). INTERPRETATION: The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-to-date information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) are the primary vector control interventions used to prevent malaria in Africa. Although both interventions are effective in some settings, high-quality evidence is rarely available to evaluate their effectiveness following deployment by a national malaria control program. In Uganda, we measured changes in key malaria indicators following universal LLIN distribution in three sites, with the addition of IRS at one of these sites. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Comprehensive malaria surveillance was conducted from October 1, 2011, to March 31, 2016, in three sub-counties with relatively low (Walukuba), moderate (Kihihi), and high transmission (Nagongera). Between 2013 and 2014, universal LLIN distribution campaigns were conducted in all sites, and in December 2014, IRS with the carbamate bendiocarb was initiated in Nagongera. High-quality surveillance evaluated malaria metrics and mosquito exposure before and after interventions through (a) enhanced health-facility-based surveillance to estimate malaria test positivity rate (TPR), expressed as the number testing positive for malaria/number tested for malaria (number of children tested for malaria: Walukuba = 42,833, Kihihi = 28,790, and Nagongera = 38,690); (b) cohort studies to estimate the incidence of malaria, expressed as the number of episodes per person-year [PPY] at risk (number of children observed: Walukuba = 340, Kihihi = 380, and Nagongera = 361); and (c) entomology surveys to estimate household-level human biting rate (HBR), expressed as the number of female Anopheles mosquitoes collected per house-night of collection (number of households observed: Walukuba = 117, Kihihi = 107, and Nagongera = 107). The LLIN distribution campaign substantially increased LLIN coverage levels at the three sites to between 65.0\% and 95.5\% of households with at least one LLIN. In Walukuba, over the 28-mo post-intervention period, universal LLIN distribution was associated with no change in the incidence of malaria (0.39 episodes PPY pre-intervention versus 0.20 post-intervention; adjusted rate ratio [aRR] = 1.02, 95\% CI 0.36-2.91, p = 0.97) and non-significant reductions in the TPR (26.5\% pre-intervention versus 26.2\% post-intervention; aRR = 0.70, 95\% CI 0.46-1.06, p = 0.09) and HBR (1.07 mosquitoes per house-night pre-intervention versus 0.71 post-intervention; aRR = 0.41, 95\% CI 0.14-1.18, p = 0.10). In Kihihi, over the 21-mo post-intervention period, universal LLIN distribution was associated with a reduction in the incidence of malaria (1.77 pre-intervention versus 1.89 post-intervention; aRR = 0.65, 95\% CI 0.43-0.98, p = 0.04) but no significant change in the TPR (49.3\% pre-intervention versus 45.9\% post-intervention; aRR = 0.83, 95\% 0.58-1.18, p = 0.30) or HBR (4.06 pre-intervention versus 2.44 post-intervention; aRR = 0.71, 95\% CI 0.30-1.64, p = 0.40). In Nagongera, over the 12-mo post-intervention period, universal LLIN distribution was associated with a reduction in the TPR (45.3\% pre-intervention versus 36.5\% post-intervention; aRR = 0.82, 95\% CI 0.76-0.88, p {\textless} 0.001) but no significant change in the incidence of malaria (2.82 pre-intervention versus 3.28 post-intervention; aRR = 1.10, 95\% 0.76-1.59, p = 0.60) or HBR (41.04 pre-intervention versus 20.15 post-intervention; aRR = 0.87, 95\% CI 0.31-2.47, p = 0.80). The addition of three rounds of IRS at 6-mo intervals in Nagongera was followed by clear decreases in all outcomes: incidence of malaria (3.25 pre-intervention versus 0.63 post-intervention; aRR = 0.13, 95\% CI 0.07-0.27, p {\textless} 0.001), TPR (37.8\% pre-intervention versus 15.0\% post-intervention; aRR = 0.54, 95\% CI 0.49-0.60, p {\textless} 0.001), and HBR (18.71 pre-intervention versus 3.23 post-intervention; aRR = 0.29, 95\% CI 0.17-0.50, p {\textless} 0.001). High levels of pyrethroid resistance were documented at all three study sites. Limitations of the study included the observational study design, the lack of contemporaneous control groups, and that the interventions were implemented under programmatic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Universal distribution of LLINs at three sites with varying transmission intensity was associated with modest declines in the burden of malaria for some indicators, but the addition of IRS at the highest transmission site was associated with a marked decline in the burden of malaria for all indicators. In highly endemic areas of Africa with widespread pyrethroid resistance, IRS using alternative insecticide formulations may be needed to achieve substantial gains in malaria control.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity in transmission is a challenge for infectious disease dynamics and control. An 80-20 “Pareto” rule has been proposed to describe this heterogeneity whereby 80\% of transmission is accounted for by 20\% of individuals, herein called super-spreaders. It is unclear, however, whether super-spreading can be attributed to certain individuals or whether it is an unpredictable and unavoidable feature of epidemics. Here, we investigate heterogeneous malaria transmission at three sites in Uganda and find that super-spreading is negatively correlated with overall malaria transmission intensity. Mosquito biting among humans is 90-10 at the lowest transmission intensities declining to less than 70-30 at the highest intensities. For super-spreaders, biting ranges from 70-30 down to 60-40. The difference, approximately half the total variance, is due to environmental stochasticity. Super-spreading is thus partly due to super-spreaders, but modest gains are expected from targeting super-spreaders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria in Sri Lanka is unstable and fluctuates in intensity both spatially and temporally. Although the case counts are dwindling at present, given the past history of resurgence of outbreaks despite effective control measures, the control programmes have to stay prepared. The availability of long time series of monitored/diagnosed malaria cases allows for the study of forecasting models, with an aim to developing a forecasting system which could assist in the efficient allocation of resources for malaria control. METHODS: Exponentially weighted moving average models, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with seasonal components, and seasonal multiplicative autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were compared on monthly time series of district malaria cases for their ability to predict the number of malaria cases one to four months ahead. The addition of covariates such as the number of malaria cases in neighbouring districts or rainfall were assessed for their ability to improve prediction of selected (seasonal) ARIMA models. RESULTS: The best model for forecasting and the forecasting error varied strongly among the districts. The addition of rainfall as a covariate improved prediction of selected (seasonal) ARIMA models modestly in some districts but worsened prediction in other districts. Improvement by adding rainfall was more frequent at larger forecasting horizons. CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity of patterns of malaria in Sri Lanka requires regionally specific prediction models. Prediction error was large at a minimum of 22\% (for one of the districts) for one month ahead predictions. The modest improvement made in short term prediction by adding rainfall as a covariate to these prediction models may not be sufficient to merit investing in a forecasting system for which rainfall data are routinely processed.

	abstract = {There is a long history of considering the constituent components of malaria risk and the malaria transmission cycle via the use of mathematical models, yet strategic planning in endemic countries tends not to take full advantage of available disease intelligence to tailor interventions. National malaria programmes typically make operational decisions about where to implement vector control and surveillance activities based upon simple categorizations of annual parasite incidence. With technological advances, an enormous opportunity exists to better target specific malaria interventions to the places where they will have greatest impact by mapping and evaluating metrics related to a variety of risk components, each of which describes a different facet of the transmission cycle. Here, these components and their implications for operational decision-making are reviewed. For each component, related mappable malaria metrics are also described which may be measured and evaluated by malaria programmes seeking to better understand the determinants of malaria risk. Implementing tailored programmes based on knowledge of the heterogeneous distribution of the drivers of malaria transmission rather than only consideration of traditional metrics such as case incidence has the potential to result in substantial improvements in decision-making. As programmes improve their ability to prioritize their available tools to the places where evidence suggests they will be most effective, elimination aspirations may become increasingly feasible.},

To provide a comprehensive description of malaria epidemiology in Uganda, we conducted surveillance studies over 24 months in 100 houses randomly selected from each of three subcounties: Walukuba (peri-urban), Kihihi (rural), and Nagongera (rural). Annual entomological inoculation rate (aEIR) was estimated from monthly Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap mosquito collections. Children aged 0.5-10 years were provided long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and followed for measures of parasite prevalence, anemia and malaria incidence. Estimates of aEIR were 2.8, 32.0, and 310 infectious bites per year, and estimates of parasite prevalence 7.4\%, 9.3\%, and 28.7\% for Walukuba, Kihihi, and Nagongera, respectively. Over the 2-year study, malaria incidence per person-years decreased in Walukuba (0.51 versus 0.31, P = 0.001) and increased in Kihihi (0.97 versus 1.93, P {\textless} 0.001) and Nagongera (2.33 versus 3.30, P {\textless} 0.001). Of 2,582 episodes of malaria, only 8 (0.3\%) met criteria for severe disease. The prevalence of anemia was low and not associated with transmission intensity. In our cohorts, where LLINs and prompt effective treatment were provided, the risk of complicated malaria and anemia was extremely low. However, malaria incidence was high and increased over time at the two rural sites, suggesting improved community-wide coverage of LLIN and additional malaria control interventions are needed in Uganda.},

	abstract = {Maps of infectious disease-charting spatial variations in the force of infection, degree of endemicity and the burden on human health-provide an essential evidence base to support planning towards global health targets. Contemporary disease mapping efforts have embraced statistical modelling approaches to properly acknowledge uncertainties in both the available measurements and their spatial interpolation. The most common such approach is Gaussian process regression, a mathematical framework composed of two components: a mean function harnessing the predictive power of multiple independent variables, and a covariance function yielding spatio-temporal shrinkage against residual variation from the mean. Though many techniques have been developed to improve the flexibility and fitting of the covariance function, models for the mean function have typically been restricted to simple linear terms. For infectious diseases, known to be driven by complex interactions between environmental and socio-economic factors, improved modelling of the mean function can greatly boost predictive power. Here, we present an ensemble approach based on stacked generalization that allows for multiple nonlinear algorithmic mean functions to be jointly embedded within the Gaussian process framework. We apply this method to mapping Plasmodium falciparum prevalence data in sub-Saharan Africa and show that the generalized ensemble approach markedly outperforms any individual method.},

Its unique biological and epidemiological characteristics pose challenges to control strategies that have been principally targeted against Plasmodium falciparum Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax infections have typically low blood-stage parasitemia with gametocytes emerging before illness manifests, and dormant liver stages causing relapses. These traits affect both its geographic distribution and transmission patterns. Asymptomatic infections, high-risk groups, and resulting case burdens are described in this review. Despite relatively low prevalence measurements and parasitemia levels, along with high proportions of asymptomatic cases, this parasite is not benign. Plasmodium vivax can be associated with severe and even fatal illness. Spreading resistance to chloroquine against the acute attack, and the operational inadequacy of primaquine against the multiple attacks of relapse, exacerbates the risk of poor outcomes among the tens of millions suffering from infection each year. Without strategies accounting for these P. vivax-specific characteristics, progress toward elimination of endemic malaria transmission will be substantially impeded.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The survival of adult female Aedes mosquitoes is a critical component of their ability to transmit pathogens such as dengue viruses. One of the principal determinants of Aedes survival is temperature, which has been associated with seasonal changes in Aedes populations and limits their geographical distribution. The effects of temperature and other sources of mortality have been studied in the field, often via mark-release-recapture experiments, and under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Survival results differ and reconciling predictions between the two settings has been hindered by variable measurements from different experimental protocols, lack of precision in measuring survival of free-ranging mosquitoes, and uncertainty about the role of age-dependent mortality in the field. METHODS: Here we apply generalised additive models to data from 351 published adult Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus survival experiments in the laboratory to create survival models for each species across their range of viable temperatures. These models are then adjusted to estimate survival at different temperatures in the field using data from 59 Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus field survivorship experiments. The uncertainty at each stage of the modelling process is propagated through to provide confidence intervals around our predictions. RESULTS: Our results indicate that adult Ae. albopictus has higher survival than Ae. aegypti in the laboratory and field, however, Ae. aegypti can tolerate a wider range of temperatures. A full breakdown of survival by age and temperature is given for both species. The differences between laboratory and field models also give insight into the relative contributions to mortality from temperature, other environmental factors, and senescence and over what ranges these factors can be important. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the importance of producing site-specific mosquito survival estimates. By including fluctuating temperature regimes, our models provide insight into seasonal patterns of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus population dynamics that may be relevant to seasonal changes in dengue virus transmission. Our models can be integrated with Aedes and dengue modelling efforts to guide and evaluate vector control, better map the distribution of disease and produce early warning systems for dengue epidemics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era, many countries in Africa achieved marked reductions in under-5 and neonatal mortality. Yet the pace of progress toward these goals substantially varied at the national level, demonstrating an essential need for tracking even more local trends in child mortality. With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which established ambitious targets for improving child survival by 2030, optimal intervention planning and targeting will require understanding of trends and rates of progress at a higher spatial resolution. In this study, we aimed to generate high-resolution estimates of under-5 and neonatal all-cause mortality across 46 countries in Africa. METHODS: We assembled 235 geographically resolved household survey and census data sources on child deaths to produce estimates of under-5 and neonatal mortality at a resolution of 5 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 5 km grid cells across 46 African countries for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. We used a Bayesian geostatistical analytical framework to generate these estimates, and implemented predictive validity tests. In addition to reporting 5 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 5 km estimates, we also aggregated results obtained from these estimates into three different levels-national, and subnational administrative levels 1 and 2-to provide the full range of geospatial resolution that local, national, and global decision makers might require. FINDINGS: Amid improving child survival in Africa, there was substantial heterogeneity in absolute levels of under-5 and neonatal mortality in 2015, as well as the annualised rates of decline achieved from 2000 to 2015. Subnational areas in countries such as Botswana, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded some of the largest decreases in child mortality rates since 2000, positioning them well to achieve SDG targets by 2030 or earlier. Yet these places were the exception for Africa, since many areas, particularly in central and western Africa, must reduce under-5 mortality rates by at least 8·8\% per year, between 2015 and 2030, to achieve the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality by 2030. INTERPRETATION: In the absence of unprecedented political commitment, financial support, and medical advances, the viability of SDG 3.2 achievement in Africa is precarious at best. By producing under-5 and neonatal mortality rates at multiple levels of geospatial resolution over time, this study provides key information for decision makers to target interventions at populations in the greatest need. In an era when precision public health increasingly has the potential to transform the design, implementation, and impact of health programmes, our 5 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 5 km estimates of child mortality in Africa provide a baseline against which local, national, and global stakeholders can map the pathways for ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

	abstract = {Global estimates of the potential impact of climate change on malaria transmission were calculated based on future climate scenarios produced by the HadCM2 and the more recent HadCM3 global climate models developed by the UK Hadley Centre. This assessment uses an improved version of the MIASMA malaria model, which incorporates knowledge about the current distributions and characteristics of the main mosquito species of malaria. The greatest proportional changes in potential transmission are forecast to occur in temperate zones, in areas where vectors are present but it is currently too cold for transmission. Within the current vector distribution limits, only a limited expansion of areas suitable for malaria transmission is forecast, such areas include: central Asia, North America and northern Europe. On a global level, the numbers of additional people at risk of malaria in 2080 due to climate change is estimated to be 300 and 150 million for P. falciparum and P. vivax types of malaria, respectively, under the HadCM3 climate change scenario. Under the HadCM2 ensemble projections, estimates of additional people at risk in 2080 range from 260 to 320 million for P. falciparum and from 100 to 200 million for P. vivax. Climate change will have an important impact on the length of the transmission season in many areas, and this has implications for the burden of disease. Possible decreases in rainfall indicate some areas that currently experience year-round transmission may experience only seasonal transmission in the future. Estimates of future populations at risk of malaria differ significantly between regions and between climate scenarios. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As successful malaria control programmes re-orientate towards elimination, the identification of transmission foci, targeting of attack measures to high-risk areas and management of importation risk become high priorities. When resources are limited and transmission is varying seasonally, approaches that can rapidly prioritize areas for surveillance and control can be valuable, and the most appropriate attack measure for a particular location is likely to differ depending on whether it exports or imports malaria infections. METHODS/RESULTS: Here, using the example of Namibia, a method for targeting of interventions using surveillance data, satellite imagery, and mobile phone call records to support elimination planning is described. One year of aggregated movement patterns for over a million people across Namibia are analyzed, and linked with case-based risk maps built on satellite imagery. By combining case-data and movement, the way human population movements connect transmission risk areas is demonstrated. Communities that were strongly connected by relatively higher levels of movement were then identified, and net export and import of travellers and infection risks by region were quantified. These maps can aid the design of targeted interventions to maximally reduce the number of cases exported to other regions while employing appropriate interventions to manage risk in places that import them. CONCLUSIONS: The approaches presented can be rapidly updated and used to identify where active surveillance for both local and imported cases should be increased, which regions would benefit from coordinating efforts, and how spatially progressive elimination plans can be designed. With improvements in surveillance systems linked to improved diagnosis of malaria, detailed satellite imagery being readily available and mobile phone usage data continually being collected by network providers, the potential exists to make operational use of such valuable, complimentary and contemporary datasets on an ongoing basis in infectious disease control and elimination.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rate (PfEIR) is a measure of exposure to infectious mosquitoes. It is usually interpreted as the number of P. falciparum infective bites received by an individual during a season or annually (aPfEIR). In an area of perennial transmission, the accuracy, precision and seasonal distribution (i.e., month by month) of aPfEIR were investigated. Data were drawn from three sites in Uganda with differing levels of transmission where falciparum malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles gambiae s.l. Estimates of aPfEIR derived from human-landing catches–the classic method for estimating biting rates–were compared with data from CDC light traps, and with catches of knock down and exit traps separately and combined. METHODS: Entomological surveillance was carried out over one year in 2011/12 in three settings: Jinja, a peri-urban area with low transmission; Kanungu, a rural area with moderate transmission; and Nagongera, Tororo District, a rural area with exceptionally high malaria transmission. Three sampling approaches were used from randomly selected houses with collections occurring once a month: human-landing collections (eight houses), CDC light traps (100 houses) and paired knock-down and exit traps each month (ten houses) for each setting. Up to 50 mosquitoes per month from each household were tested for sporozoites with P. falciparum by ELISA. Human biting rate (HBR) data were estimated month by month. P. falciparum Sporozoite rate (PfSR) for yearly and monthly data and confidence intervals were estimated using the binomial exact test. Monthly and yearly estimates of the HBR, the PfSR, and the PfEIR were estimated and compared. RESULTS: The estimated aPfEIR values using human-landing catch data were 3.8 (95\% Confidence Intervals, CI 0-11.4) for Jinja, 26.6 (95\% CI 7.6-49.4) for Kanungu, and 125 (95\% CI 72.2-183.0) for Tororo. In general, the monthly PfEIR values showed strong seasonal signals with two peaks from May-June and October-December, although the precise timing of the peaks differed between sites. Estimated HBRs using human-landing catches were strongly correlated with those made using CDC light traps (r(2) = 0.67, p {\textless} 0.001), and with either knock-down catches (r(2) = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.001) and exit traps (r(2) = 0.82, p {\textless} 0.001) or the combined catches (r(2) = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.001). Using CDC light trap catch data, the PfSR in Tororo was strongly negatively correlated with monthly HBR (r(2) = 0.44, p = 0.01). In other sites, no patterns in the PfSR were discernible because either the number P. falciparum of sporozoite positive mosquitoes or the total number of mosquitoes caught was too low. CONCLUSIONS: In these settings, light traps provide an alternative method for sampling indoor-resting mosquitoes to human-landing catches and have the advantage that they protect individuals from being bitten during collection, are easy to use and are not subject to collector bias. Knock-down catches and exit traps could also be used to replace human-landing catches. Although these are cheaper, they are subject to collector bias.},

We created a mathematical model of VRE transmission in an intensive care unit (ICU) using data from an existing active surveillance program; we used the model to generate the estimated benefits associated with active surveillance. Simulations predicted that active surveillance in a 10-bed ICU would result in a 39\% reduction in the annual incidence of VRE colonization when compared with no surveillance. Initial isolation of all patients, with withdrawal of isolation if the results of surveillance cultures are negative, was predicted to result in a 65\% reduction. Passive surveillance was minimally effective. Using the best available data, active surveillance is projected to be effective for reducing VRE transmission in ICU settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although Plasmodium falciparum transmission frequently exhibits seasonal patterns, the drivers of malaria seasonality are often unclear. Given the massive variation in the landscape upon which transmission acts, intra-annual fluctuations are likely influenced by different factors in different settings. Further, the presence of potentially substantial inter-annual variation can mask seasonal patterns; it may be that a location has “strongly seasonal” transmission and yet no single season ever matches the mean, or synoptic, curve. Accurate accounting of seasonality can inform efficient malaria control and treatment strategies. In spite of the demonstrable importance of accurately capturing the seasonality of malaria, data required to describe these patterns is not universally accessible and as such localized and regional efforts at quantifying malaria seasonality are disjointed and not easily generalized. METHODS: The purpose of this review was to audit the literature on seasonality of P. falciparum and quantitatively summarize the collective findings. Six search terms were selected to systematically compile a list of papers relevant to the seasonality of P. falciparum transmission, and a questionnaire was developed to catalogue the manuscripts. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 152 manuscripts were identified as relating to the seasonality of malaria transmission, deaths due to malaria or the population dynamics of mosquito vectors of malaria. Among these, there were 126 statistical analyses and 31 mechanistic analyses (some manuscripts did both). DISCUSSION: Identified relationships between temporal patterns in malaria and climatological drivers of malaria varied greatly across the globe, with different drivers appearing important in different locations. Although commonly studied drivers of malaria such as temperature and rainfall were often found to significantly influence transmission, the lags between a weather event and a resulting change in malaria transmission also varied greatly by location. CONCLUSIONS: The contradicting results of studies using similar data and modelling approaches from similar locations as well as the confounding nature of climatological covariates underlines the importance of a multi-faceted modelling approach that attempts to capture seasonal patterns at both small and large spatial scales.},

The needs for accurate measures of progress and practical advice about how to allocate scarce resources require new analytical methods to quantify fine-grained heterogeneity in malaria risk. Using routine national surveillance data from Swaziland (a sub-Saharan country on the verge of elimination), we estimated individual reproductive numbers. Fine-grained maps of reproductive numbers and local malaria importation rates were combined to show 'malariogenic potential', a first for malaria elimination. As countries approach elimination, these individual-based measures of transmission risk provide meaningful metrics for planning programmatic responses and prioritizing areas where interventions will contribute most to malaria elimination.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diarrheal diseases are the third leading cause of disease and death in children younger than 5 years of age in Africa and were responsible for an estimated 30 million cases of severe diarrhea (95\% credible interval, 27 million to 33 million) and 330,000 deaths (95\% credible interval, 270,000 to 380,000) in 2015. The development of targeted approaches to address this burden has been hampered by a paucity of comprehensive, fine-scale estimates of diarrhea-related disease and death among and within countries. METHODS: We produced annual estimates of the prevalence and incidence of diarrhea and diarrhea-related mortality with high geographic detail (5 km2) across Africa from 2000 through 2015. Estimates were created with the use of Bayesian geostatistical techniques and were calibrated to the results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016. RESULTS: The results revealed geographic inequality with regard to diarrhea risk in Africa. Of the estimated 330,000 childhood deaths that were attributable to diarrhea in 2015, more than 50\% occurred in 55 of the 782 first-level administrative subdivisions (e.g., states). In 2015, mortality rates among first-level administrative subdivisions in Nigeria differed by up to a factor of 6. The case fatality rates were highly varied at the national level across Africa, with the highest values observed in Benin, Lesotho, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed concentrated areas of diarrheal disease and diarrhea-related death in countries that had a consistently high burden as well as in countries that had considerable national-level reductions in diarrhea burden.

	abstract = {Summary Background Since 2000, the scale-up of malaria control interventions has substantially reduced morbidity and mortality caused by the disease globally, fuelling bold aims for disease elimination. In tandem with increased availability of geospatially resolved data, malaria control programmes increasingly use high-resolution maps to characterise spatially heterogeneous patterns of disease risk and thus efficiently target areas of high burden. Methods We updated and refined the Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate and clinical incidence models for sub-Saharan Africa, which rely on cross-sectional survey data for parasite rate and intervention coverage. For malaria endemic countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, we produced estimates of parasite rate and incidence by applying an ecological downscaling approach to malaria incidence data acquired via routine surveillance. Mortality estimates were derived by linking incidence to systematically derived vital registration and verbal autopsy data. Informed by high-resolution covariate surfaces, we estimated P falciparum parasite rate, clinical incidence, and mortality at national, subnational, and 5 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 5 km pixel scales with corresponding uncertainty metrics. Findings We present the first global, high-resolution map of P falciparum malaria mortality and the first global prevalence and incidence maps since 2010. These results are combined with those for Plasmodium vivax (published separately) to form the malaria estimates for the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study. The P falciparum estimates span the period 2000–17, and illustrate the rapid decline in burden between 2005 and 2017, with incidence declining by 27·9\% and mortality declining by 42·5\%. Despite a growing population in endemic regions, P falciparum cases declined between 2005 and 2017, from 232·3 million (95\% uncertainty interval 198·8–277·7) to 193·9 million (156·6–240·2) and deaths declined from 925 800 (596 900–1 341 100) to 618 700 (368 600–952 200). Despite the declines in burden, 90·1\% of people within sub-Saharan Africa continue to reside in endemic areas, and this region accounted for 79·4\% of cases and 87·6\% of deaths in 2017. Interpretation High-resolution maps of P falciparum provide a contemporary resource for informing global policy and malaria control planning, programme implementation, and monitoring initiatives. Amid progress in reducing global malaria burden, areas where incidence trends have plateaued or increased in the past 5 years underscore the fragility of hard-won gains against malaria. Efforts towards elimination should be strengthened in such areas, and those where burden remained high throughout the study period. Funding Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

Development and survival rates of both the Anopheles mosquitoes and the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria depend on temperature, making this a potential driver of mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission. We developed a temperature-dependent, stage-structured delayed differential equation model to better understand how climate determines risk. Including the full mosquito life cycle in the model reveals that the mosquito population abundance is more sensitive to temperature than previously thought because it is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the juvenile mosquito stages whose vital rates are also temperature-dependent. Additionally, the model predicts a peak in abundance of mosquitoes old enough to vector malaria at more accurate temperatures than previous models. Our results point to the importance of incorporating detailed vector biology into models for predicting the risk for vector borne diseases.},

Recent work has shown that mosquito and parasite biology are influenced not only by average temperature, but also by the extent of the daily temperature variation. Here we examine how parasite development within the mosquito (Extrinsic Incubation Period) is expected to vary over time and space depending on the diurnal temperature range and baseline mean temperature in Kenya and across Africa. Our results show that under cool conditions, the typical approach of using mean monthly temperatures alone to characterize the transmission environment will underestimate parasite development. In contrast, under warmer conditions, the use of mean temperatures will overestimate development. Qualitatively similar patterns hold using both outdoor and indoor temperatures. These findings have important implications for defining malaria risk. Furthermore, understanding the influence of daily temperature dynamics could provide new insights into ectotherm ecology both now and in response to future climate change.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The duration of untreated Plasmodium falciparum infections in naturally exposed human populations is of interest for rational planning of malaria control interventions as it is related to the duration of infectivity. The extent of variability in duration is relevant where transmission is seasonal, and for the planning of elimination efforts. Methods for measuring these quantities from genotyping data have been restricted to exponential models of infection survival, as implied by constant clearance rates. Such models have greatly improved the understanding of infection dynamics on a population level but likely misrepresent the within-host dynamics of many pathogens. Conversely, the statistical properties of the distribution of infection durations, and how these are affected by exposure, should contain information on within-host dynamics. METHODS AND RESULTS: We extended existing methods for the analysis of longitudinal genotyping data on P. falciparum infections. Our method simultaneously estimates force of infection, detectability, and the distribution of infection durations. Infection durations are modeled using parametric survival distributions. The method is validated using simulated data, and applied to data from a cohort study in Navrongo, Northern Ghana. Distribution estimates from exponential, Weibull, lognormal, and gamma models are compared with the distribution of durations in malariatherapy data. CONCLUSIONS: The Weibull model fitted the data best. It estimated a shorter mean duration than the exponential model, which gave the worst fit. The distribution estimates appeared positively skewed when compared with the distribution of durations in malariatherapy data, suggesting that a significant proportion of infections is cleared shortly after inoculation. We conclude that malariatherapy data, the most important source of information on P. falciparum within-host dynamics, may not be representative of the actual processes in natural populations, and should be used with care. Further, conclusions from transmission models assuming exponential infection survival may be biased.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets in preventing malaria is threatened by developing resistance against pyrethroids. Little is known about how strongly this affects the effectiveness of vector control programmes. METHODS: Data from experimental hut studies on the effects of long-lasting, insecticidal nets (LLINs) on nine anopheline mosquito populations, with varying levels of mortality in World Health Organization susceptibility tests, were used to parameterize malaria models. Both simple static models predicting population-level insecticidal effectiveness and protection against blood feeding, and complex dynamic epidemiological models, where LLINs decayed over time, were used. The epidemiological models, implemented in OpenMalaria, were employed to study the impact of a single mass distribution of LLINs on malaria, both in terms of episodes prevented during the effective lifetime of the batch of LLINs, and in terms of net health benefits (NHB) expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted during that period, depending on net type (standard pyrethroid-only LLIN or pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide combination LLIN), resistance status, coverage and pre-intervention transmission level. RESULTS: There were strong positive correlations between insecticide susceptibility status and predicted population level insecticidal effectiveness of and protection against blood feeding by LLIN intervention programmes. With the most resistant mosquito population, the LLIN mass distribution averted up to about 40\% fewer episodes and DALYs during the effective lifetime of the batch than with fully susceptible populations. However, cost effectiveness of LLINs was more sensitive to the pre-intervention transmission level and coverage than to susceptibility status. For four out of the six Anopheles gambiae sensu lato populations where direct comparisons between standard LLINs and combination LLINs were possible, combination nets were more cost effective, despite being more expensive. With one resistant population, both net types were equally effective, and with one of the two susceptible populations, standard LLINs were more cost effective. CONCLUSION: Despite being less effective when compared to areas with susceptible mosquito populations, standard and combination LLINs are likely to (still) be cost effective against malaria even in areas with strong pyrethroid resistance. Combination nets are likely to be more cost effective than standard nets in areas with resistant mosquito populations.},

This review summarizes what is understood about naturally acquired and experimentally induced immunity against malaria with the help of evolving insights provided by biotechnology and places these insights in the context of historical, clinical, and epidemiological observations. We advocate that naturally acquired immunity should be appreciated as being virtually 100\% effective against severe disease and death among heavily exposed adults. Even the immunity that occurs in exposed infants may exceed 90\% effectiveness. The induction of an adult-like immune status among high-risk infants in sub-Saharan Africa would greatly diminish disease and death caused by P. falciparum. The mechanism of naturally acquired immunity that occurs among adults living in areas of hyper- to holoendemicity should be understood with a view toward duplicating such protection in infants and young children in areas of endemicity.},

Although the densities of the vectors and the theoretical inoculation rates had almost returned to pre-spraying levels the prevalence of malaria parasites in the human population was still significantly less than formerly. Serological findings, however, suggested that more transmission was occurring than was shown by the parasite rates. As well as pre-existing immunity, an important factor in the delayed resurgence of malaria, and in the dissociation between parasite rates on the one hand and inoculation and antibody prevalence rates on the other, was the widespread use of antimalaria drugs. There was an indication of a fall in mean haemoglobin levels towards those of the period before malaria control. {\textbackslash}copyright 1972.},

(2) There are local variations in the degree of transmission in different groups of villages due to the varying proximity of these to the breeding sites of the vectors, A. gambiae and A. funestus. (3) Compared with coastal areas, and with some other inland areas of E. Africa, the sporozoite rates of the vectors are very low. In the case of A. gambiae this is due to the considerable feeding on cattle and other hosts than man which occurs in this area, together with a lower natural survival due to the arid climate. For A. funestus a lower survival is the chief factor. (4) As a result of a lower transmission, due to the low sporozoite rates, there is a different pattern of immune response in the human population when this is compared with areas where transmission is heavier.

	abstract = {1) A sequel to an earlier paper describes the effects, during 3 years, on the vector mosquitoes and on the human malaria of the spraying of huts with the residual insecticide Dieldrin. 2) Typical A. funestus completely disappeared and there were great reductions in the numbers of A. gambiae found alive in huts. The population of A. gambiae was also reduced, except in places where there were opportunities for extensive feeding on cattle. There were no changes in the host choices of A. gambiae. In many dissections for sporozoites the only infected mosquitoes found were from inadequately sprayed places. 3) The action of Dieldrin was studied. Although it caused some irritation and its lethal action was slow, Dieldrin, in the dosages used, was found to cause a high mortality amongst A. gambiae coming into contact with sprayed surfaces, and this effect was very persistent. No change in susceptibility to Dieldrin occurred in A. gambiae, but this was found in other arthropods. 4) There was a considerable fall in all human malaria indices, but evidence from several sources suggested that a low degree of malaria transmission continued throughout. 5) Possible reasons for this are discussed, with the causes of persistent parasites in older children. {\textbackslash}copyright 1960 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum has been widely studied, but its effects on parasite dynamics are poorly understood. Acquisition and clearance rates of untreated infections are key elements of the dynamics of malaria, but estimating these parameters is challenging because of frequent super-infection and imperfect detectability of parasites. Consequently, information on effects of host immune status or age on infection dynamics is fragmentary. METHODS: An age-stratified cohort of 347 individuals from Northern Ghana was sampled six times at 2 month intervals. High-throughput capillary electrophoresis was used to genotype the msp-2 locus of all P. falciparum infections detected by PCR. Force of infection (FOI) and duration were estimated for each age group using an immigration-death model that allows for imperfect detection of circulating parasites. RESULTS: Allowing for imperfect detection substantially increased estimates of FOI and duration. Effects of naturally acquired immunity on the FOI and duration would be reflected in age dependence in these indices, but in our cohort data FOI tended to increase with age in children. Persistence of individual parasite clones was characteristic of all age-groups. Duration peaked in 5-9 year old children (average duration 319 days, 95\% confidence interval 318;320). CONCLUSIONS: The main age-dependence is on parasite densities, with only small age-variations in the FOI and persistence of infections. This supports the hypothesis that acquired immunity controls transmission mainly by limiting blood-stage parasite densities rather than changing rates of acquisition or clearance of infections.},

We observed that the distribution of mosquito bites exceeded the Pareto rule (20/80) in two of the three surveys performed (20/85, 76, and 96) and, at its most pronounced, is estimated to have profound epidemiological consequences, inflating the basic reproduction number of malaria by 8-fold. The distribution of bites from sporozoite-positive mosquitoes followed a similar pattern, with a small number of individuals within households receiving multiple potentially infectious bites over the period of a few days. Together, our findings indicate that heterogeneity in mosquito exposure contributes considerably to heterogeneity in infection risk and suggest significant variation in malaria transmission potential.},

RESULTS: Data from the majority of mosquito studies conformed to a generic schema, with data collection forms recording the experimental design, sorting of collections, details of sample pooling or subdivision, and additional observations. Generically applicable forms with standardized attribute definitions enabled rigorous, consistent data and sample management with generic software and minimal expertise. Forms use now includes 20 experiments, 8 projects, and 15 users at 3 research and control institutes in 3 African countries, resulting in 11 peer-reviewed publications. CONCLUSION: We have designed generic data schema that can be used to develop paper or electronic based data collection forms depending on the availability of resources. We have developed paper-based data collection forms that can be used to collect data from majority of entomological studies across multiple study areas using standardized data formats. Data recorded on these forms with standardized formats can be entered and linked with any relational database software. These informatics tools are recommended because they ensure that medical entomologists save time, improve data quality, and data collected and shared across multiple studies is in standardized formats hence increasing research outputs.},

We update a systematic review to map the prevalence of K540E and A581G mutations in 294 surveys of infected humans across Africa from 2004-present. Interpreting these data is complicated by multiclonal infections in humans, especially in high transmission areas. We extend statistical methods to estimate the frequency, i.e. the proportion of resistant clones in the parasite population at each location, and so standardise for varying transmission levels. Both K540E and A581G mutations increased in prevalence and frequency in 60\% of areas after 2008, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance. Resistance measures within countries were similar within 300 km, suggesting an appropriate spatial scale for surveillance. Spread of the mutations tended to accelerate once their prevalence exceeded 10\% (prior to fixation). Frequencies of resistance in parasite populations are the same or lower than prevalence in humans, so more areas would be classified as likely to benefit from IPT if similar frequency thresholds were applied. We propose that the use of resistance frequencies as well as prevalence measures for policy decisions should be evaluated.},

Based on this analysis we discuss some of the pitfalls associated with the use of classical statistical techniques for resolving the uncertainties associated with modeling population dynamics. The management of the Serengeti wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) is used as a case study. We fitted a collection of age-structured and unstructured models to a common set of available data and compared model predictions in terms of wildebeest viability and harvest. Models that depicted demographic processes in strikingly different ways fitted the data equally well. However, upon further analysis it became clear that models that fit the data equally well could nonetheless have very different management implications. In general, model structure had a much larger effect on viability analysis (e.g., time to collapse) than on optimal harvest analysis (e.g., harvest rate that maximizes harvest). Some modeling decisions, such as including age-dependent fertility rates, did not affect management predictions, but others had a strong effect (e.g., choice of model structure). Because several suitable models of comparable complexity fitted the data equally well, traditional model selection methods based on the parsimony principle were not practical for judging the value of alternative models. Our results stress the need to implement analytical frameworks for population management that explicitly consider the uncertainty about the behavior of natural systems.},

	abstract = {In regions of high rates of malaria transmission, mosquitoes repeatedly transmit liver-tropic Plasmodium sporozoites to individuals who already have blood-stage parasitemia. This manifests itself in semi-immune children (who have been exposed since birth to Plasmodium infection and as such show low levels of peripheral parasitemia but can still be infected) older than 5 years of age by concurrent carriage of different parasite genotypes at low asymptomatic parasitemias. Superinfection presents an increased risk of hyperparasitemia and death in less immune individuals but counterintuitively is not frequently observed in the young. Here we show in a mouse model that ongoing blood-stage infections, above a minimum threshold, impair the growth of subsequently inoculated sporozoites such that they become growth arrested in liver hepatocytes and fail to develop into blood-stage parasites. Inhibition of the liver-stage infection is mediated by the host iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, whose synthesis we found to be stimulated by blood-stage parasites in a density-dependent manner. We mathematically modeled this phenomenon and show how density-dependent protection against liver-stage malaria can shape the epidemiological patterns of age-related risk and the complexity of malaria infections seen in young children. The interaction between these two Plasmodium stages and host iron metabolism has relevance for the global efforts to reduce malaria transmission and for evaluation of iron supplementation programs in malaria-endemic regions.},

When examined 4 months later all those found infected on the first examination were clear of parasites while, conversely, a number who were uninfected earlier had a parasitaemia.

	abstract = {Optimal intervention for disease outbreaks is often impeded by severe scientific uncertainty. Adaptive management (AM), long-used in natural resource management, is a structured decision-making approach to solving dynamic problems that accounts for the value of resolving uncertainty via real-time evaluation of alternative models. We propose an AM approach to design and evaluate intervention strategies in epidemiology, using real-time surveillance to resolve model uncertainty as management proceeds, with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) culling and measles vaccination as case studies. We use simulations of alternative intervention strategies under competing models to quantify the effect of model uncertainty on decision making, in terms of the value of information, and quantify the benefit of adaptive versus static intervention strategies. Culling decisions during the 2001 UK FMD outbreak were contentious due to uncertainty about the spatial scale of transmission. The expected benefit of resolving this uncertainty prior to a new outbreak on a UK-like landscape would be {\textbackslash}pounds45-{\textbackslash}pounds60 million relative to the strategy that minimizes livestock losses averaged over alternate transmission models. AM during the outbreak would be expected to recover up to {\textbackslash}pounds20.1 million of this expected benefit. AM would also recommend a more conservative initial approach (culling of infected premises and dangerous contact farms) than would a fixed strategy (which would additionally require culling of contiguous premises). For optimal targeting of measles vaccination, based on an outbreak in Malawi in 2010, AM allows better distribution of resources across the affected region; its utility depends on uncertainty about both the at-risk population and logistical capacity. When daily vaccination rates are highly constrained, the optimal initial strategy is to conduct a small, quick campaign; a reduction in expected burden of approximately 10,000 cases could result if campaign targets can be updated on the basis of the true susceptible population. Formal incorporation of a policy to update future management actions in response to information gained in the course of an outbreak can change the optimal initial response and result in significant cost savings. AM provides a framework for using multiple models to facilitate public-health decision making and an objective basis for updating management actions in response to improved scientific understanding.},

A three-day course of quinine was administered to 48 asymptomatic adults between 19 and 66 years of age. Malaria transmission and parasitemia were monitored every week for two months and cases of fever or symptoms were investigated as part of a daily clinical surveillance. The proportion of persons reinfected at Days 28, 35, and 56 was 25\%, 38\%, and 54\%, respectively. Adults less than 40 years of age had a shorter time to reinfection. In this age group, the median Plasmodium falciparum reappearance time was 28 days, and it was estimated that only one infected mosquito bite was able to induce a patent infection among half of the subjects. Only 8\% (2 of 26) of the reinfections caused a clinical attack. These data are discussed in the light of previous studies conducted among adults naturally exposed to intense perennial transmission or among naive volunteers receiving artificial challenges. Rapid reinfection occurs at very low EIRs and dramatic differences in actual and cumulated exposure to infected mosquito bites poorly affect the median time to reappearance of malaria parasites in endemic populations.},

	abstract = {It is widely perceived that immunity to malaria is, to an extent, defective and that one component of this defective immune response is the inability to induce or maintain long-term memory responses. If true, this is likely to pose problems for development of an effective vaccine against malaria. In this article, we critically review and challenge this interpretation of the epidemiological and experimental evidence. While evasion and modulation of host immune responses clearly occurs and naturally acquired immunity is far from optimal, mechanisms to control blood-stage parasites are acquired and maintained by individuals living in endemic areas, allowing parasite density to be kept below the threshold for induction of acute disease. Furthermore, protective immunity to severe pathology is achieved relatively rapidly and is maintained in the absence of boosting by re-infection. Nevertheless, there are significant challenges to overcome. The need for multiple infections to acquire immunity means that young children remain at risk of infection for far too long. Persistent or frequent exposure to antigen seems to be required to maintain anti-parasite immunity (premunition). Lastly, pre-erythrocytic and sexual stages of the life cycle are poorly immunogenic, and there is little evidence of effective pre-erythrocytic or transmission-blocking immunity at the population level. While these problems might theoretically be due to defective immunological memory, we suggest alternative explanations. Moreover, we question the extent to which these problems are malaria-specific rather than generic (i.e. result from inherent limitations of the vertebrate immune system).},

	abstract = {Evaluating the effectiveness of malaria control interventions on the basis of their impact on transmission as well as impact on morbidity and mortality is becoming increasingly important as countries consider pre-elimination and elimination as well as disease control. Data on prevalence and transmission are traditionally obtained through resource-intensive epidemiological and entomological surveys that become difficult as transmission decreases. This work employs mathematical modeling to examine the relationships between malaria indicators allowing more easily measured data, such as routine health systems data on case incidence, to be translated into measures of transmission and other malaria indicators. Simulations of scenarios with different levels of malaria transmission, patterns of seasonality and access to treatment were run with an ensemble of models of malaria epidemiology and within-host dynamics, as part of the OpenMalaria modeling platform. For a given seasonality profile, regression analysis mapped simulation results of malaria indicators, such as annual average entomological inoculation rate, prevalence, incidence of uncomplicated and severe episodes, and mortality, to an expected range of values of any of the other indicators. Results were validated by comparing simulated relationships between indicators with previously published data on these same indicators as observed in malaria endemic areas. These results allow for direct comparisons of malaria transmission intensity estimates made using data collected with different methods on different indicators. They also address key concerns with traditional methods of quantifying transmission in areas of differing transmission intensity and sparse data. Although seasonality of transmission is often ignored in data compilations, the models suggest it can be critically important in determining the relationship between transmission and disease. Application of these models could help public health officials detect changes of disease dynamics in a population and plan and assess the impact of malaria control interventions.},

The fatality rate was 11.2\%. In multivariate analysis, circulatory collapse, impaired consciousness, hypoglycemia, and malnutrition independently predicted death. Children with severe malaria by the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification, but not by the previous one (1990), showed relatively mild clinical manifestations and a low case fatality rate (3.2\%). In hospitalized children with severe malaria in northern Ghana, severe anemia is the leading manifestation, but itself does not contribute to mortality. In this region, malnutrition and circulatory collapse were important predictors of fatal malaria.

	abstract = {The observations recorded were carried out in an isolated village the inhabitants of which usually suffered their malaria without specific treatment. The parasite and spleen rates in the region varied between 30 and 40 per cent. Weekly observations were made from May 1931 and August 1934. A total of 76 negro children, between the ages of 5 and 15, were kept under observation; they rarely if ever received any antimalarial drug. At each visit the species of plasmodia: was determined and sexual and asexual parasite counts were made; the spleen was measured, the oral temperature was taken and notes were made regarding any subjective symptoms of the child. In all, 10, 228 blood smears were examined, of which 5, 140 contained parasites, the percentage of species being P. falciparum 56.63, P. vivax 27.33, P. malariae 6.48, P. vivax and falciparum 8.92, P. vivax and malariae 0.33, P. falciparum and malariae 0.23, and all three species 0.08. Of the 76 individuals 41 showed all three parasites at one time or another; 29 showed P. falciparum and P. vivax on different occasions; 5 showed P. falciparum alone, and 1 had a mixed P. falciparum arid malariae infection. The maximum parasite counts per cmm. of blood were P. falciparum 206, 103, P. vivax 46, 215, P. malariae 6, 486. The maximum gametocyte counts were P. falciparum 16, 376, P. vivax 560, P. malariae 1, 081. There was marked variation in the distribution of parasites. P. falciparum was found most frequently to the exclusion of other parasites. Often P. vivax infections were replaced rapidly by P. falciparum, P. vivax only reappearing when P, falciparum infection had reached a very low level. Gametocytes of two species were sometimes observed in a single smear but high counts of both were rarely observed. The incidence of P, falciparum parasites in smears was highest immediately following rises in mosquito density. The incidence of P. malariae gametocytes was highest just after the incidence of P. falciparum gametocytes had reached its lowest point. The authors believe that the onset of a new infection can be determined and that each infection probably ran a definite course to a natural cure. Fever was most common in P. falciparum infections at the time of, or within ten weeks after, the sharp rise in parasite counts indicative of new infections. Highest parasite counts and largest spleens were found within very few weeks after the onset of the first observed infections. The highest proportion with gametocytes was found in the first week of P. vivax infections, in the third week of P. falciparum infections. N. W.},

It is problematical to determine the duration of infections because of the difficulty of distinguishing persisting infections from new ones, and because parasite densities are often transiently below the limit of detection. We recently developed a dynamic model for infection incidence, clearance and detection of multiple genotype P. falciparum infections and fitted it to a panel dataset from a longitudinal study in Northern Ghana. We now extend this model to allow for seasonal and age variation in infection rates and also age dependence in clearance and in detectability of infections. These models indicate that there is seasonal variation in the infection rate, and age dependence in detectability. The best fitting models had no age dependence in infection or clearance rates, suggesting that acquired immunity mainly affects detectability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The duration of untreated Plasmodium falciparum infections is a defining characteristic of the parasite's biology. It is not clear whether naturally acquired immunity (NAI) can shorten infections, despite the potential implications for malaria control and elimination as well as for basic research. METHODS: Data on the presence of P. falciparum msp2 genotypes in six blood samples collected over one year was analysed, together with four samples collected over 1 week, from a cohort in Navrongo (Ghana). Mathematical models assuming either exponential, Weibull, gamma, or log-normal infection durations were estimated separately for six age-groups. The method allowed for varying clonal acquisition and detection rates. RESULTS: The best fitting (Weibull) mean durations were 124 days (children 10 years). This non-monotonic age pattern is not suggestive of an infection-clearing effect of NAI since immunity increases with exposure, and thus, age. Age-related differences in innate immunity are a more plausible explanation. 21\% of blood-stage infections terminated within 1 week, in stark contrast to months of persistence in infections induced in neuro-syphilis patients (malariatherapy data). Age independence in this percentage raises the possibility that this clearance may result from innate mechanisms or genetic incompatibility between hosts and parasites, rather than from NAI. CONCLUSION: In all ages of hosts a substantial proportion of infections are cleared in the first days or weeks of appearance in the blood, while others persist for many months. Although cumulative exposure and NAI increase with age, this does apparently not translate into an increased rate of termination of infections.},

Their unique bionomics, particularly their anthropophilic, endophagic and endophilic characters, guarantee a strong mosquito-host interaction, favorable to malaria transmission. Olfactory cues govern the various behaviors of female mosquitoes and here we review the role of semiochemicals in the life history of African malaria vectors. Recent evidence points towards the existence of human-specific kairomones affecting host-seeking A. gambiae s.l., and efforts are under way to identify the volatiles mediating this behavior. Based on examples from other Culicidae spp., it is argued that there is good reason to assume that mating, sugar feeding, and oviposition behavior in Afrotropical malaria vectors may also be mediated by semiochemicals. It is foreseen that increased knowledge of odor-mediated behaviors will be applied in the development of novel sampling techniques and possibly alternative methods of intervention to control malaria.},

	abstract = {Control of aquatic-stage Anopheles is one of the oldest and most historically successful interventions to prevent malaria, but it has seen little application in Africa. Consequently, the ecology of immature afrotropical Anopheles has received insufficient attention. We therefore examined the population dynamics of African anopheline and culicine mosquitoes using operationally practicable techniques to examine the relative importance and availability of different larval habitats in an area of perennial malaria transmission in preparation for a pilot-scale larval control programme. The study was conducted in Mbita, a rural town on the shores of Lake Victoria in Western Kenya, over 20 months. Weekly larval surveys were conducted to identify the availability of stagnant water, habitat characteristics and larval densities. Adult mosquitoes were collected indoors at fortnightly intervals. Availability of aquatic habitats and abundance of mosquito larvae were directly correlated with rainfall. Adult mosquito densities followed similar patterns but with a time-lag of approximately 1 month. About 70\% of all available habitats were man-made, half of them representing cement-lined pits. On average, 67\% of all aquatic habitats on a given sampling date were colonized by Anopheles larvae, of which all identified morphologically were A. gambiae sensu lato. Natural and artificial habitats were equally productive over the study period and larval densities were positively correlated with presence of tufts of low vegetation and negatively with non-matted algal content. The permanence of a habitat had no significant influence on larval productivity. We conclude that A. gambiae is broadly distributed across a variety of habitat types, regardless of permanence. All potential breeding sites need to be considered as sources of malaria risk at any time of the year and exhaustively targeted in any larval control intervention.},

Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, increased human connectivity and changeable human behavior, elevate prevention and control from matters of national policy to international challenge.

The association of hepcidin with hemoglobin was not linear and hepcidin was very low in severe malarial anemia. Parasite density, IL-10 and IL-6 were significantly associated with hepcidin concentration. Hepcidin response to acute malaria supports the notion of iron sequestration during acute malaria infection and suggests that iron administration during acute malaria is futile.

METHODS:We collected data from 21 therapeutic efficacy trials conducted in India during 2009-2010 and estimated the contribution of each age group to the reservoir of transmission. We built a predictive model for gametocytemia and calculated the diagnostic utility of different score cut-offs from our risk score. RESULTS:Gametocytemia was present in 18\% (248/1 335) of patients and decreased with age. Adults constituted 43\%, school-age children 45\% and under fives 12\% of the reservoir for potential transmission. Our model retained age, sex, region and previous antimalarial drug intake as predictors of gametocytemia. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.76 (95\%CI:0.73,0.78), and a cut-off of 14 or more on a risk score ranging from 0 to 46 provided 91\% (95\%CI:88,95) sensitivity and 33\% (95\%CI:31,36) specificity for detecting gametocytemia. CONCLUSIONS:Gametocytemia was common in India and varied by region. Notably, adults contributed substantially to the reservoir for potential transmission.

Alcohol consumption is rising in developing countries and, as efforts to manage malaria are expanded, understanding the links between malaria and alcohol consumption becomes crucial. Our aim was to ascertain the effect of beer consumption on human attractiveness to malaria mosquitoes in semi field conditions in Burkina Faso. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We used a Y tube-olfactometer designed to take advantage of the whole body odour (breath and skin emanations) as a stimulus to gauge human attractiveness to Anopheles gambiae (the primary African malaria vector) before and after volunteers consumed either beer (n = 25 volunteers and a total of 2500 mosquitoes tested) or water (n = 18 volunteers and a total of 1800 mosquitoes). Water consumption had no effect on human attractiveness to An. gambiae mosquitoes, but beer consumption increased volunteer attractiveness. Body odours of volunteers who consumed beer increased mosquito activation (proportion of mosquitoes engaging in take-off and up-wind flight) and orientation (proportion of mosquitoes flying towards volunteers' odours). The level of exhaled carbon dioxide and body temperature had no effect on human attractiveness to mosquitoes. Despite individual volunteer variation, beer consumption consistently increased attractiveness to mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:These results suggest that beer consumption is a risk factor for malaria and needs to be integrated into public health policies for the design of control measures.},

	abstract = {The use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in disease surveys and reporting is becoming increasingly routine, enabling a better understanding of spatial epidemiology and the improvement of surveillance and control strategies. In turn, the greater availability of spatially referenced epidemiological data is driving the rapid expansion of disease mapping and spatial modeling methods, which are becoming increasingly detailed and sophisticated, with rigorous handling of uncertainties. This expansion has, however, not been matched by advancements in the development of spatial datasets of human population distribution that accompany disease maps or spatial models.Where risks are heterogeneous across population groups or space or dependent on transmission between individuals, spatial data on human population distributions and demographic structures are required to estimate infectious disease risks, burdens, and dynamics. The disease impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, and speed of spread varies substantially with demographic profiles, so that identifying the most exposed or affected populations becomes a key aspect of planning and targeting interventions. Subnational breakdowns of population counts by age and sex are routinely collected during national censuses and maintained in finer detail within microcensus data. Moreover, demographic and health surveys continue to collect representative and contemporary samples from clusters of communities in low-income countries where census data may be less detailed and not collected regularly. Together, these freely available datasets form a rich resource for quantifying and understanding the spatial variations in the sizes and distributions of those most at risk of disease in low income regions, yet at present, they remain unconnected data scattered across national statistical offices and websites.In this paper we discuss the deficiencies of existing spatial population datasets and their limitations on epidemiological analyses. We review sources of detailed, contemporary, freely available and relevant spatial demographic data focusing on low income regions where such data are often sparse and highlight the value of incorporating these through a set of examples of their application in disease studies. Moreover, the importance of acknowledging, measuring, and accounting for uncertainty in spatial demographic datasets is outlined. Finally, a strategy for building an open-access database of spatial demographic data that is tailored to epidemiological applications is put forward.},

This community effect on nearby compounds without nets is approximately as strong as the effect observed within villages with ITNs. This implies that in areas with intense malaria transmission with high ITN coverage, the primary effect of insecticide-treated nets is via area-wide effects on the mosquito population and not, as commonly supposed, by simple imposition of a physical barrier protecting individuals from biting. The strength of the community effect depended upon the proportion of nearby compounds with treated nets. To maximize their public health impact, high coverage with treated nets is essential.},

	abstract = {As malaria is being pushed back on many frontiers and global case numbers are declining, accurate measurement and prediction of transmission becomes increasingly difficult. Low transmission settings are characterised by high levels of spatial heterogeneity, which stands in stark contrast to the widely used assumption of spatially homogeneous transmission used in mathematical transmission models for malaria. In the present study an individual-based mathematical malaria transmission model that incorporates multiple parasite clones, variable human exposure and duration of infection, limited mosquito flight distance and most importantly geographically heterogeneous human and mosquito population densities was used to illustrate the differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous transmission assumptions when aiming to predict surrogate indicators of transmission intensity such as population parasite prevalence or multiplicity of infection (MOI). In traditionally highly malaria endemic regions where most of the population harbours malaria parasites, humans are often infected with multiple parasite clones. However, studies have shown also in areas with low overall parasite prevalence, infection with multiple parasite clones is a common occurrence. Mathematical models assuming homogeneous transmission between humans and mosquitoes cannot explain these observations. Heterogeneity of transmission can arise from many factors including acquired immunity, body size and occupational exposure. In this study, we show that spatial heterogeneity has a profound effect on predictions of MOI and parasite prevalence. We illustrate, that models assuming homogeneous transmission underestimate average MOI in low transmission settings when compared to field data and that spatially heterogeneous models predict stable transmission at much lower overall parasite prevalence. Therefore it is very important that models used to guide malaria surveillance and control strategies in low transmission and elimination settings take into account the spatial features of the specific target area, including human and mosquito vector distribution.},

	abstract = {Recent declines in malaria burden in many parts of the world have prompted consideration of how interruption of Plasmodium falciparum transmission could be maintained, if achieved, and notably whether large-scale vector control could be replaced with surveillance. This information is essential for elimination feasibility assessments and planning. The risk of re-establishment of transmission depends mainly on vectorial capacity (receptivity), likely to rebound once vector control is removed, the rate of importation of infections (vulnerability), the capacity to detect and treat infections and the level of immunity in infected individuals. Timely detection and removal of new infections is likely to be critical to prevent re-establishment of transmission. We assess, through mathematical modeling and simulation, which levels of case detection and treatment (case management) are required to prevent re-establishment of transmission of P. falciparum after local interruption of transmission has been achieved, in settings with varying receptivity and vulnerability. We find that, even at rather low levels of receptivity, case management alone cannot reliably prevent re-establishment of P. falciparum malaria transmission in the face of medium to high importation rates. Thus, if vector control is to be discontinued, preventing the importations by controlling transmission in source areas will generally be necessary for preventing reintroduction in such settings, and cannot be substituted by very high levels of case management coverage.},

Accurate disease forecasting models would markedly improve epidemic prevention and control capabilities. This chapter examines the potential for epidemic forecasting and discusses the issues associated with the development of global networks for surveillance and prediction. Existing global systems for epidemic preparedness focus on disease surveillance using either expert knowledge or statistical modelling of disease activity and thresholds to identify times and areas of risk. Predictive health information systems would use monitored environmental variables, linked to a disease system, to be observed and provide prior information of outbreaks.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies increasingly rely on nucleic acid test (NAT) methods to detect and quantify parasites in the blood of infected participants. The lower limits of detection and quantification vary amongst the assays used throughout the world, which may affect the ability of mathematical models to accurately estimate the liver-to-blood inoculum (LBI) values that are used to judge the efficacy of pre-erythrocytic vaccine and drug candidates. METHODS:Samples were collected around the time of onset of pre-patent parasitaemia from subjects who enrolled in two different CHMI clinical trials. Blood samples were tested for Plasmodium falciparum 18S rRNA and/or rDNA targets by different NAT methods and results were compared. Methods included an ultrasensitive, large volume modification of an established quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay that achieves detection of as little as one parasite/mL of whole blood. RESULTS:Large volume qRT-PCR at the University of Washington was the most sensitive test and generated quantifiable data more often than any other NAT methodology. Standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) performed at the University of Oxford and standard volume qRT-PCR performed at the University of Washington were less sensitive than the large volume qRT-PCR, especially at 6.5 days after CHMI. In these trials, the proportion of participants for whom LBI could be accurately quantified using parasite density value greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantification was increased. A greater improvement would be expected in trials in which numerous subjects receive a lower LBI or low dose challenge. CONCLUSIONS:Standard qPCR and qRT-PCR methods with analytical sensitivities of {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde20 parasites/mL probably suffice for most CHMI purposes, but the newly developed large volume qRT-PCR may be able to answer specific questions when more analytical sensitivity is required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Primaquine is a key drug for malaria elimination. In addition to being the only drug active against the dormant relapsing forms of Plasmodium vivax, primaquine is the sole effective treatment of infectious P. falciparum gametocytes, and may interrupt transmission and help contain the spread of artemisinin resistance. However, primaquine can trigger haemolysis in patients with a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDd). Poor information is available about the distribution of individuals at risk of primaquine-induced haemolysis. We present a continuous evidence-based prevalence map of G6PDd and estimates of affected populations, together with a national index of relative haemolytic risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS:Representative community surveys of phenotypic G6PDd prevalence were identified for 1,734 spatially unique sites. These surveys formed the evidence-base for a Bayesian geostatistical model adapted to the gene's X-linked inheritance, which predicted a G6PDd allele frequency map across malaria endemic countries (MECs) and generated population-weighted estimates of affected populations. Highest median prevalence (peaking at 32.5\%) was predicted across sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Although G6PDd prevalence was generally lower across central and southeast Asia, rarely exceeding 20\%, the majority of G6PDd individuals (67.5\% median estimate) were from Asian countries. We estimated a G6PDd allele frequency of 8.0\% (interquartile range: 7.4-8.8) across MECs, and 5.3\% (4.4-6.7) within malaria-eliminating countries. The reliability of the map is contingent on the underlying data informing the model; population heterogeneity can only be represented by the available surveys, and important weaknesses exist in the map across data-sparse regions. Uncertainty metrics are used to quantify some aspects of these limitations in the map. Finally, we assembled a database of G6PDd variant occurrences to inform a national-level index of relative G6PDd haemolytic risk. Asian countries, where variants were most severe, had the highest relative risks from G6PDd. CONCLUSIONS:G6PDd is widespread and spatially heterogeneous across most MECs where primaquine would be valuable for malaria control and elimination. The maps and population estimates presented here reflect potential risk of primaquine-associated harm. In the absence of non-toxic alternatives to primaquine, these results represent additional evidence to help inform safe use of this valuable, yet dangerous, component of the malaria-elimination toolkit.

	abstract = {We reviewed interventions that affect maternal and child undernutrition and nutrition-related outcomes. These interventions included promotion of breastfeeding; strategies to promote complementary feeding, with or without provision of food supplements; micronutrient interventions; general supportive strategies to improve family and community nutrition; and reduction of disease burden (promotion of handwashing and strategies to reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy). We showed that although strategies for breastfeeding promotion have a large effect on survival, their effect on stunting is small. In populations with sufficient food, education about complementary feeding increased height-for-age Z score by 0.25 (95\% CI 0.01-0.49), whereas provision of food supplements (with or without education) in populations with insufficient food increased the height-for-age Z score by 0.41 (0.05-0.76). Management of severe acute malnutrition according to WHO guidelines reduced the case-fatality rate by 55\% (risk ratio 0.45, 0.32-0.62), and recent studies suggest that newer commodities, such as ready-to-use therapeutic foods, can be used to manage severe acute malnutrition in community settings. Effective micronutrient interventions for pregnant women included supplementation with iron folate (which increased haemoglobin at term by 12 g/L, 2.93-21.07) and micronutrients (which reduced the risk of low birthweight at term by 16\% (relative risk 0.84, 0.74-0.95). Recommended micronutrient interventions for children included strategies for supplementation of vitamin A (in the neonatal period and late infancy), preventive zinc supplements, iron supplements for children in areas where malaria is not endemic, and universal promotion of iodised salt. We used a cohort model to assess the potential effect of these interventions on mothers and children in the 36 countries that have 90\% of children with stunted linear growth. The model showed that existing interventions that were designed to improve nutrition and prevent related disease could reduce stunting at 36 months by 36\%; mortality between birth and 36 months by about 25\%; and disability-adjusted life-years associated with stunting, severe wasting, intrauterine growth restriction, and micronutrient deficiencies by about 25\%. To eliminate stunting in the longer term, these interventions should be supplemented by improvements in the underlying determinants of undernutrition, such as poverty, poor education, disease burden, and lack of women's empowerment.},

Man- agers are faced with three main types of uncertainty: uncertainty about biological and environmental processes, and observational uncertainty. Active adaptive management (AAM) is management with a deliberate plan for learning about the managed system, so that management can be improved in the face of uncertainty. We discuss the potential benefits of applying AAM to insect pest and weed control with reference to a number of examples. We first address the possible uses for AAM in biological control, with particular reference to agent selection and release. We also propose applying AAM methods to re- sistance management and to spatial strategies for pest control. We conclude with an overview of AAM, a discussion of some of the potential limitations to its use in pest management, and the possibilities for increased implementation of AAM in the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The global burden of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is set to rise as a consequence of improved survival in high-prevalence low- and middle-income countries and population migration to higher-income countries. The host of quantitative evidence documenting these changes has not been assembled at the global level. The purpose of this study is to estimate trends in the future number of newborns with SCA and the number of lives that could be saved in under-five children with SCA by the implementation of different levels of health interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS:First, we calculated projected numbers of newborns with SCA for each 5-y interval between 2010 and 2050 by combining estimates of national SCA frequencies with projected demographic data. We then accounted for under-five mortality (U5m) projections and tested different levels of excess mortality for children with SCA, reflecting the benefits of implementing specific health interventions for under-five patients in 2015, to assess the number of lives that could be saved with appropriate health care services. The estimated number of newborns with SCA globally will increase from 305,800 (confidence interval [CI]: 238,400-398,800) in 2010 to 404,200 (CI: 242,500-657,600) in 2050. It is likely that Nigeria (2010: 91,000 newborns with SCA [CI: 77,900-106,100]; 2050: 140,800 [CI: 95,500-200,600]) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2010: 39,700 [CI: 32,600-48,800]; 2050: 44,700 [CI: 27,100-70,500]) will remain the countries most in need of policies for the prevention and management of SCA. We predict a decrease in the annual number of newborns with SCA in India (2010: 44,400 [CI: 33,700-59,100]; 2050: 33,900 [CI: 15,900-64,700]). The implementation of basic health interventions (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, penicillin prophylaxis, and vaccination) for SCA in 2015, leading to significant reductions in excess mortality among under-five children with SCA, could, by 2050, prolong the lives of 5,302,900 [CI: 3,174,800-6,699,100] newborns with SCA. Similarly, large-scale universal screening could save the lives of up to 9,806,000 (CI: 6,745,800-14,232,700) newborns with SCA globally, 85\% (CI: 81\%-88\%) of whom will be born in sub-Saharan Africa. The study findings are limited by the uncertainty in the estimates and the assumptions around mortality reductions associated with interventions. CONCLUSIONS:Our quantitative approach confirms that the global burden of SCA is increasing, and highlights the need to develop specific national policies for appropriate public health planning, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Further empirical collaborative epidemiological studies are vital to assess current and future health care needs, especially in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and India.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases often demonstrate heterogeneity of transmission among host populations. This heterogeneity reduces the efficacy of control strategies, but also implies that focusing control strategies on “hotspots” of transmission could be highly effective. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In order to identify hotspots of malaria transmission, we analysed longitudinal data on febrile malaria episodes, asymptomatic parasitaemia, and antibody titres over 12 y from 256 homesteads in three study areas in Kilifi District on the Kenyan coast. We examined heterogeneity by homestead, and identified groups of homesteads that formed hotspots using a spatial scan statistic. Two types of statistically significant hotspots were detected; stable hotspots of asymptomatic parasitaemia and unstable hotspots of febrile malaria. The stable hotspots were associated with higher average AMA-1 antibody titres than the unstable clusters (optical density [OD] = 1.24, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.47 versus OD = 1.1, 95\% CI 0.88-1.33) and lower mean ages of febrile malaria episodes (5.8 y, 95\% CI 5.6-6.0 versus 5.91 y, 95\% CI 5.7-6.1). A falling gradient of febrile malaria incidence was identified in the penumbrae of both hotspots. Hotspots were associated with AMA-1 titres, but not seroconversion rates. In order to target control measures, homesteads at risk of febrile malaria could be predicted by identifying the 20\% of homesteads that experienced an episode of febrile malaria during one month in the dry season. That 20\% subsequently experienced 65\% of all febrile malaria episodes during the following year. A definition based on remote sensing data was 81\% sensitive and 63\% specific for the stable hotspots of asymptomatic malaria. CONCLUSIONS: Hotspots of asymptomatic parasitaemia are stable over time, but hotspots of febrile malaria are unstable. This finding may be because immunity offsets the high rate of febrile malaria that might otherwise result in stable hotspots, whereas unstable hotspots necessarily affect a population with less prior exposure to malaria.},

The models bring together published and unpublished data on the larval and adult ecology of A. aegypti in Wat Samphaya, Bangkok, Thailand. (2) The most appropriate analytical model is a generalization of a continuous time model used by Gurney, Blythe \& Nisbet (1980) to describe Nicholson's blowfly populations. Despite uncertainty about egg-laying rate, local stability analysis firmly predicts that the population in Wat Samphaya is monotonically stable. Equilibrium analysis predicts that adult populations will be more sensitive to changes in death rate than to changes in either birth rate or number of larval breeding sites. Accurate prediction of equilibrium population size requires good estimates of parameters (beta s) describing density-dependent mortality. (3) Results of stability analysis with the simulation model accord with those of the analytical model: observed fluctuations in adult population size are unlikely to be driven cycles, but rather due to fluctuations in adult survivorship combined with strong density-dependent larval mortality. Equilibrium analysis reinforces the conclusion that the adult population is more sensitive to changes in adult survivorship than to changes in fecundity.]},

Results indicate that early treatment, and a high antibody threshold coupled with a long lag time between antibody stimulation and activity, are risk factors which increase the likelihood of developing a viable drug-resistant parasite population. High parasite mutation rates and fast PfEMP1 var gene switching are also identified as risk factors.

	doi = {10.1186/1756-3305-6-17},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) are commonly used together even though evidence that such combinations confer greater protection against malaria than either method alone is inconsistent. METHODS:A deterministic model of mosquito life cycle processes was adapted to allow parameterization with results from experimental hut trials of various combinations of untreated nets or LLINs (Olyset, PermaNet 2.0, Icon Life nets) with IRS (pirimiphos methyl, lambda cyhalothrin, DDT), in a setting where vector populations are dominated by Anopheles arabiensis, so that community level impact upon malaria transmission at high coverage could be predicted. RESULTS:Intact untreated nets alone provide equivalent personal protection to all three LLINs. Relative to IRS plus untreated nets, community level protection is slightly higher when Olyset or PermaNet 2.0 nets are added onto IRS with pirimiphos methyl or lambda cyhalothrin but not DDT, and when Icon Life nets supplement any of the IRS insecticides. Adding IRS onto any net modestly enhances communal protection when pirimiphos methyl is sprayed, while spraying lambda cyhalothrin enhances protection for untreated nets but not LLINs. Addition of DDT reduces communal protection when added to LLINs. CONCLUSIONS:Where transmission is mediated primarily by An. arabiensis, adding IRS to high LLIN coverage provides only modest incremental benefit (e.g. when an organophosphate like pirimiphos methyl is used), but can be redundant (e.g. when a pyrethroid like lambda cyhalothin is used) or even regressive (e.g. when DDT is used for the IRS). Relative to IRS plus untreated nets, supplementing IRS with LLINs will only modestly improve community protection. Beyond the physical protection that intact nets provide, additional protection against transmission by An. arabiensis conferred by insecticides will be remarkably small, regardless of whether they are delivered as LLINs or IRS. The insecticidal action of LLINs and IRS probably already approaches their absolute limit of potential impact upon this persistent vector so personal protection of nets should be enhanced by improving the physical integrity and durability. Combining LLINs and non-pyrethroid IRS in residual transmission systems may nevertheless be justified as a means to manage insecticide resistance and prevent potential rebound of not only An. arabiensis, but also more potent, vulnerable and historically important species such as Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus.},

	abstract = {Active adaptive management balances the requirements of management with the need to learn about the system being managed, which leads to better decisions. It is difficult to judge the benefit of management actions that accelerate information gain, relative to the benefit of making the best management decision given what is known at the time. We present a first step in developing methods to optimize management decisions that incorporate both uncertainty and learning via adaptive management. We assumed a manager can allocate effort to discrete units (e.g., areas for revegetation or animals for reintroduction), the outcome can be measured as success or failure (e.g., the revegetation in an area is successful or the animal survives and breeds), and the manager has two possible management options from which to choose. We further assumed that there is an annual budget that may be allocated to one or both of the two options and that the manager must decide on the allocation. We used Bayesian updating of the probability of success of the two options and stochastic dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy over a specified number of years. The costs, level of certainty about the success of the two options, and the timeframe of management all influenced the optimal allocation of the annual budget. In addition, the choice of management objective had a large influence on the optimal decision. In a case study of Merri Creek, Melbourne, Australia, we applied the approach to determining revegetation strategies. Our approach can be used to determine how best to manage ecological systems in the face of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {An assessment was done in Tanzania to determine the extent to which the primary health care services have contributed to reducing the burden of malaria since the system was initiated in the 1980s. Seven descriptive processes and outcome indicators of effectiveness were used: changes of malaria transmission and incidence over time; use of facility-based care services for malaria; patients' access to professional advice; the trend of treatment failure over time of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and chloroquine; survival rates of severe cases at the district hospital; a district malaria control strategy; number of malaria specific training for care providers; and the number of activities carried out on mosquito control measures. The data were collected from 1996 to 2003 in the Muheza district northeastern Tanzania. It covered household interviews with a stratified sample of 1,250 respondents, and in-depth interviews with all 175 health care providers in the 35 health facilities within the district. All six members of the district health management team were also interviewed. Additional data came from dispensary and hospital records, and published literature. The results show an unchanged malaria disease burden. The average number of clinical malaria episodes per child less than five years of age remained between 3 and 3.5 episodes per year in the district since the 1960s. The comparison of cases expected in the population less than five years old with those seen in the district health facilities shows a coverage rate of 33\%. Furthermore, between 1990 and 2003, little training on malaria was provided to health staff. The findings imply a limited effectiveness of district health services on malaria control, suggesting a weak process of translating national malaria goals to activities at the district level.},

We developed a mathematical model to explore the potential for RDT-led diagnosis to drive selection of pfhrp2-deleted parasites. Low malaria prevalence and high frequencies of people seeking treatment resulted in the greatest selection pressure. Calibrating our model against confirmed pfhrp2-deletions in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we estimate a starting frequency of 6\% pfhrp2-deletion prior to RDT introduction. Furthermore, the patterns observed necessitate a degree of selection driven by the introduction of PfHRP2-based RDT-guided treatment. Combining this with parasite prevalence and treatment coverage estimates, we map the model-predicted spread of pfhrp2-deletion, and identify the geographic regions in which surveillance for pfhrp2-deletion should be prioritised.},

This varies among species and is affected by insecticidal irritancy. Exophilic behavior has evolved in certain populations exposed to prolonged spraying programs. Optimum effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets presumably depends on vectors biting at hours when most people are in bed. Time of biting varies among different malaria vector species, but so far there is inconclusive evidence for these evolving so as to avoid bednets. Use of an untreated net diverts extra biting to someone in the same room who is without a net. Understanding choice of oviposition sites and dispersal behavior is important for the design of successful larval control programs including those using predatory mosquito larvae. Prospects for genetic control by sterile males or genes rendering mosquitoes harmless to humans will depend on competitive mating behavior.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Models of Plasmodium falciparum malaria epidemiology that provide realistic quantitative predictions of likely epidemiological outcomes of existing vector control strategies have the potential to assist in planning for the control and elimination of malaria. This work investigates the applicability of mathematical modelling of malaria transmission dynamics in Rachuonyo South, a district with low, unstable transmission in the highlands of western Kenya. METHODS:Individual-based stochastic simulation models of malaria in humans and a deterministic model of malaria in mosquitoes as part of the OpenMalaria platform were parameterized to create a scenario for the study area based on data from ongoing field studies and available literature. The scenario was simulated for a period of two years with a population of 10,000 individuals and validated against malaria survey data from Rachuonyo South. Simulations were repeated with multiple random seeds and an ensemble of 14 model variants to address stochasticity and model uncertainty. A one-dimensional sensitivity analysis was conducted to address parameter uncertainty. RESULTS:The scenario was able to reproduce the seasonal pattern of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) and patent infections observed in an all-age cohort of individuals sampled monthly for one year. Using an EIR estimated from serology to parameterize the scenario resulted in a closer fit to parasite prevalence than an EIR estimated using entomological methods. The scenario parameterization was most sensitive to changes in the timing and effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and the method used to detect P. falciparum in humans. It was less sensitive than expected to changes in vector biting behaviour and climatic patterns. CONCLUSIONS:The OpenMalaria model of P. falciparum transmission can be used to simulate the impact of different combinations of current and potential control interventions to help plan malaria control in this low transmission setting. In this setting and for these scenarios, results were highly sensitive to transmission, vector exophagy, exophily and susceptibility to IRS, and the detection method used for surveillance. The level of accuracy of the results will thus depend upon the precision of estimates for each. New methods for analysing and evaluating uncertainty in simulation results will enhance the usefulness of simulations for malaria control decision-making. Improved measurement tools and increased primary data collection will enhance model parameterization and epidemiological monitoring. Further research is needed on the relationship between malaria indices to identify the best way to quantify transmission in low transmission settings. Measuring EIR through mosquito collection may not be the optimal way to estimate transmission intensity in areas with low, unstable transmission.},

Over the past 30 years, the burden of dengue has increased exponentially, due to urbanization, poor waste and water management, human transportation, and expanding mosquito populations. Although much research has been conducted on Ae. aegypti at the household and container levels, little is known about the mechanisms fueling the range expansion of this mosquito across longer distances. The goal of this study is to characterize Ae. aegypti spread along transportation networks and to identify risk factors associated with its establishment, thus improving our ability to predict future Ae. aegypti expansion. Characterizing current patterns of establishment will aid in understanding and preventing future invasions. Our approach is broadly applicable to other biological invasions associated with human activities.},

They should attempt to measure, not transmission rate, but changes in transmission rate. In this case, the less restrictive assumption that parasites are responsible for constant bias (rather than no bias) leads to relatively small errors. The results encourage a more optimistic view of the performance of classical entomological indices such as the parous rate. They should also help to redirect the principal epidemiological question about vector-parasite interactions: future studies should be concerned with the impact of parasites, not directly on Vectorial Capacity, but on the comparative measures which are actually used to evaluate transmission rate.},

Despite this, the pathways to changing inequalities in the SDH remain elusive. The methodologies and concepts within system science are now viewed as important domains of knowledge, ideas and skills for tackling issues of inequality, which are increasingly understood as emergent properties of complex systems. In this paper, we introduce and expand the concept of adaptive policies to reduce inequalities in the distribution of the SDH. The concept of adaptive policy for health equity was developed through reviewing the literature on learning and adaptive policies. Using a series of illustrative examples from education and poverty alleviation, which have their basis in real world policies, we demonstrate how an adaptive policy approach is more suited to the management of the emergent properties of inequalities in the SDH than traditional policy approaches. This is because they are better placed to handle future uncertainties. Our intention is that these examples are illustrative, rather than prescriptive, and serve to create a conversation regarding appropriate adaptive policies for progressing policy action on the SDH.},

Melioidosis can be difficult to diagnose due to its diverse clinical manifestations and the inadequacy of conventional bacterial identification methods(3). The bacterium is intrinsically resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials, and treatment with ineffective antimicrobials may result in case fatality rates (CFRs) exceeding 70\%(4,5). The importation of infected animals has, in the past, spread melioidosis to non-endemic areas(6,7). The global distribution of B. pseudomallei and the burden of melioidosis, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we map documented human and animal cases and the presence of environmental B. pseudomallei and combine this in a formal modelling framework(8-10) to estimate the global burden of melioidosis. We estimate there to be 165,000 (95\% credible interval 68,000-412,000) human melioidosis cases per year worldwide, from which 89,000 (36,000-227,000) people die. Our estimates suggest that melioidosis is severely underreported in the 45 countries in which it is known to be endemic and that melioidosis is probably endemic in a further 34 countries that have never reported the disease. The large numbers of estimated cases and fatalities emphasize that the disease warrants renewed attention from public health officials and policy makers.},

	abstract = {In the last 15 years, dengue fever has emerged as a major health problem in tropical America. Prevention and control of epidemic disease are enhanced by the rapid identification of new or increased dengue activity. Most surveillance systems, however, identify cases by clinical case reports and, therefore, lack the sensitivity needed for early detection. During the 1986 dengue 1 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the authors evaluated the usefulness of a clinical case definition by comparing it with laboratory-confirmed infection status of residents in two cities. The case definition had a sensitivity of 64\% and a false-positive rate of 57\%. Thus, for every 100 laboratory-confirmed dengue infections, 230 cases were reported. Both infected and noninfected residents who used medical services and who lived in the city with the highest transmission were more likely to meet the case definition. Thus, factors unrelated to actual infection influenced the sensitivity. With the use of stepwise logistic regression, the authors analyzed combinations of patient symptoms and produced nine new hypothetical case definitions. However, none of the new definitions had a false-positive rate lower than 38\%. This study emphasizes the need for laboratory-based dengue surveillance systems.},

Fine scale multi-temporal mapping in low malaria transmission settings remains a challenge and the World Health Organisation propose use of surveillance in elimination settings. Here, we show how malaria incidence can be modelled at a fine spatial and temporal resolution from health facility data to help focus surveillance and control to population not attending health facilities. Using Namibia as a case study, we predicted the incidence of malaria, via a Bayesian spatio-temporal model, at a fine spatial resolution from parasitologically confirmed malaria cases and incorporated metrics on healthcare use as well as measures of uncertainty associated with incidence predictions. We then combined the incidence estimates with population maps to estimate clinical burdens and show the benefits of such mapping to identifying areas and seasons that can be targeted for improved surveillance and interventions. Fine spatial resolution maps produced using this approach were then used to target resources to specific local populations, and to specific months of the season. This remote targeting can be especially effective where the population distribution is sparse and further surveillance can be limited to specific local areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Current malaria control initiatives aim at reducing malaria burden by half by the year 2010. Effective control requires evidence-based utilisation of resources. Characterizing spatial patterns of risk, through maps, is an important tool to guide control programmes. To this end an analysis was carried out to predict and map malaria risk in Malawi using empirical data with the aim of identifying areas where greatest effort should be focussed. METHODS:Point-referenced prevalence of infection data for children aged 1-10 years were collected from published and grey literature and geo-referenced. The model-based geostatistical methods were applied to analyze and predict malaria risk in areas where data were not observed. Topographical and climatic covariates were added in the model for risk assessment and improved prediction. A Bayesian approach was used for model fitting and prediction. RESULTS:Bivariate models showed a significant association of malaria risk with elevation, annual maximum temperature, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET). However in the prediction model, the spatial distribution of malaria risk was associated with elevation, and marginally with maximum temperature and PET. The resulting map broadly agreed with expert opinion about the variation of risk in the country, and further showed marked variation even at local level. High risk areas were in the low-lying lake shore regions, while low risk was along the highlands in the country. CONCLUSION:The map provided an initial description of the geographic variation of malaria risk in Malawi, and might help in the choice and design of interventions, which is crucial for reducing the burden of malaria in Malawi.},

This will ensure new studies can build on the work that has gone before. These data and results also need to be made available to groups who are developing public health policies based on up-to-date evidence. The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) has collated and geopositioned over 50,000 parasite prevalence and vector occurrence survey records contributed by over 3,000 sources including research groups, government agencies and non-governmental organizations worldwide. This paper describes the results of a project set up to release data gathered, used and generated by MAP. METHODS:Requests for permission to release data online were sent to 236 groups who had contributed unpublished prevalence (parasite rate) surveys. An online explorer tool was developed so that users can visualize the spatial distribution of the vector and parasite survey data before downloading it. In addition, a consultation group was convened to provide advice on the mode and format of release for data generated by MAP's modelling work. New software was developed to produce a suite of publication-quality map images for download from the internet for use in external publications. CONCLUSION:More than 40,000 survey records can now be visualized on a set of dynamic maps and downloaded from the MAP website on a free and unrestricted basis. As new data are added and new permissions to release existing data come in, the volume of data available for download will increase. The modelled data output from MAP's own analyses are also available online in a range of formats, including image files and GIS surface data, for use in advocacy, education, further research and to help parameterize or validate other mathematical models.},

Environmental variables are known to affect substantially the population dynamics and abundance of the poikilothermic vectors of disease, but the exact extent of this sensitivity is not well established. Focusing on malaria and its main vector in Africa, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, we present a set of novel mathematical models of climate-driven mosquito population dynamics motivated by experimental data suggesting that in An. gambiae, mortality is temperature and age dependent. We compared the performance of these models to that of a “standard” model ignoring age dependence. We used a longitudinal dataset of vector abundance over 36 months in sub-Saharan Africa for comparison between models that incorporate age dependence and one that does not, and observe that age-dependent models consistently fitted the data better than the reference model. This highlights that including age dependence in the vector component of mosquito-borne disease models may be important to predict more reliably disease transmission dynamics. Further data and studies are needed to enable improved fitting, leading to more accurate and informative model predictions for the An. gambiae malaria vector as well as for other disease vectors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of long-lasting, insecticidal nets (LLINs) in preventing malaria is threatened by the changing biting behaviour of mosquitoes, from nocturnal and endophagic to crepuscular and exophagic, and by their increasing resistance to insecticides. METHODS: Using epidemiological stochastic simulation models, we studied the impact of a mass LLIN distribution on Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Specifically, we looked at impact in terms of episodes prevented during the effective life of the batch and in terms of net health benefits (NHB) expressed in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, depending on biting behaviour, resistance (as measured in experimental hut studies), and on pre-intervention transmission levels. RESULTS: Results were very sensitive to assumptions about the probabilistic nature of host searching behaviour. With a shift towards crepuscular biting, under the assumption that individual mosquitoes repeat their behaviour each gonotrophic cycle, LLIN effectiveness was far less than when individual mosquitoes were assumed to vary their behaviour between gonotrophic cycles. LLIN effectiveness was equally sensitive to variations in host-searching behaviour (if repeated) and to variations in resistance. LLIN effectiveness was most sensitive to pre-intervention transmission level, with LLINs being least effective at both very low and very high transmission levels, and most effective at around four infectious bites per adult per year. A single LLIN distribution round remained cost effective, except in transmission settings with a pre-intervention inoculation rate of over 128 bites per year and with resistant mosquitoes that displayed a high proportion (over 40\%) of determined crepuscular host searching, where some model variants showed negative NHB. CONCLUSIONS: Shifts towards crepuscular host searching behaviour can be as important in reducing LLIN effectiveness and cost effectiveness as resistance to pyrethroids. As resistance to insecticides is likely to slow down the development of behavioural resistance and vice versa, the two types of resistance are unlikely to occur within the same mosquito population. LLINs are likely cost effective interventions against malaria, even in areas with strong resistance to pyrethroids or where a large proportion of host-mosquito contact occurs during times when LLIN users are not under their nets.},

The risks of morbidity and mortality associated with malaria are characterized by spatial and temporal variation across the country. This study examines the spatial and temporal patterns of malaria transmission at the local level and implements a risk mapping tool to aid in monitoring and disease control activities. METHODS:In this study, we examine the global and local patterns of malaria distribution in 543 villages in East Shoa, central Ethiopia using individual-level morbidity data collected from six laboratory and treatment centers between September 2002 and August 2006. RESULTS:Statistical analysis of malaria incidence by sex, age, and village through time reveal the presence of significant spatio-temporal variations. Poisson regression analysis shows a decrease in malaria incidence with increasing age. A significant difference in the malaria incidence density ratio (IDRs) is detected in males but not in females. A significant decrease in the malaria IDRs with increasing age is captured by a quadratic model. Local spatial statistics reveals clustering or hot spots within a 5 and 10 km distance of most villages in the study area. In addition, there are temporal variations in malaria incidence. CONCLUSION:Malaria incidence varies according to gender and age, with males age 5 and above showing a statistically higher incidence. Significant local clustering of malaria incidence occurs between pairs of villages within 1-10 km distance lags. Malaria incidence was higher in 2002-2003 than in other periods of observation. Malaria hot spots are displayed as risk maps that are useful for monitoring and spatial targeting of prevention and control measures against the disease.},

The rationale is that treating individuals reduces their infectivity. We present a geostatistical framework for designing TasP-based HIV elimination strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. We focused on Lesotho, where 25\% of the population is infected. We constructed a density of infection map by gridding high-resolution demographic data and spatially smoothing georeferenced HIV testing data. The map revealed the countrywide geographic dispersion pattern of HIV-infected individuals. We found that 20\% of the HIV-infected population lives in urban areas and that almost all rural communities have at least one HIV-infected individual. We used the map to design an optimal elimination strategy and identified which communities should use TasP. This strategy minimized the area that needed to be covered to find and treat HIV-infected individuals. We show that UNAIDS's elimination strategy would not be feasible in Lesotho because it would require deploying treatment in areas where there are 4 infected individuals/km2 Our results show that the spatial dispersion of Lesotho's population hinders, and may even prevent, the elimination of HIV.},

	abstract = {Roll back malaria (RBM) aims at halving the current burden of the disease by the year 2010. The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, and it is proposed to implement efficacious and cost-effective control strategies. But the evidence base of such information is scarce, and a notable missing element is the discussion of the potential of environmental management. We reviewed the literature and identified multiple malaria control programmes that incorporated environmental management as the central feature. Prominent among them are programmes launched in 1929 and implemented for two decades at copper mining communities in Zambia. The full package of control measures consisted of vegetation clearance, modification of river boundaries, draining swamps, oil application to open water bodies and house screening. Part of the population also was given quinine and was sleeping under mosquito nets. Monthly malaria incidence rates and vector densities were used for surveillance and adaptive tuning of the environmental management strategies to achieve a high level of performance. Within 3-5 years, malaria-related mortality, morbidity and incidence rates were reduced by 70-95\%. Over the entire 20 years of implementation, the programme had averted an estimated 4173 deaths and 161,205 malaria attacks. The estimated costs per death and malaria attack averted were US\$ 858 and US\$ 22.20, respectively. Over the initial 3-5 years start-up period, analogous to the short-duration of cost-effectiveness analyses of current studies, we estimated that the costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted were US\$ 524-591. However, the strategy has a track record of becoming cost-effective in the longer term, as maintenance costs were much lower: US\$ 22-92 per DALY averted. In view of fewer adverse ecological effects, increased sustainability and better uses of local resources and knowledge, environmental management–integrated with pharmacological, insecticidal and bednet interventions–could substantially increase the chances of rolling back malaria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Although the effects of rainfall on the population dynamics of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae have been studied in great detail, the effects of dry periods on its survival remain less clear. METHODS:The effects of drying conditions were simulated by creating desiccated habitats, which consisted of trays filled with damp soil. Experiments were performed in these trays to (i) test the ability of An. gambiae sensu stricto eggs to hatch on damp soil and for larvae to reach an artificial breeding site at different distances of the site of hatching and (ii) to record survival of the four larval stages of An. gambiae s.s. when placed on damp soil. RESULTS:Eggs of An. gambiae s.s. hatched on damp soil and emerging larvae were capable of covering a distance of up to 10 cm to reach surface water enabling further development. However, proportions of larvae reaching the site decreased rapidly with increasing distance. First, second and third-instar larvae survived on damp soil for an estimated period of 64, 65 and 69 hrs, respectively. Fourth-instar larvae survived significantly longer and we estimated that the maximum survival time was 113 hrs. CONCLUSION:Short-term survival of aquatic stages of An. gambiae on wet soil may be important and adaptive when considering the transient nature of breeding sites of this species in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the results suggest that, for larval vector control methods to be effective, habitats should remain drained for at least 5 days to kill all larvae (e.g. in rice fields) and habitats that recently dried up should be treated as well, if larvicidal agents are applied.},

Globally, the housing need is most acute in Africa, where the population will more than double by 2050. However, existing data on housing quality across Africa are limited primarily to urban areas and are mostly recorded at the national level. Here we quantify changes in housing in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2015 by combining national survey data within a geostatistical framework. We show a marked transformation of housing in urban and rural sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2015, with the prevalence of improved housing (with improved water and sanitation, sufficient living area and durable construction) doubling from 11\% (95\% confidence interval, 10-12\%) to 23\% (21-25\%). However, 53 (50-57) million urban Africans (47\% (44-50\%) of the urban population analysed) were living in unimproved housing in 2015. We provide high-resolution, standardized estimates of housing conditions across sub-Saharan Africa. Our maps provide a baseline for measuring change and a mechanism to guide interventions during the era of the Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Mosquito biting frequency and how bites are distributed among different people can have significant epidemiologic effects. An improved understanding of mosquito vector-human interactions would refine knowledge of the entomological processes supporting pathogen transmission and could reveal targets for minimizing risk and breaking pathogen transmission cycles. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We used human DNA blood meal profiling of the dengue virus (DENV) vector, Aedes aegypti, to quantify its contact with human hosts and to infer epidemiologic implications of its blood feeding behavior. We determined the number of different people bitten, biting frequency by host age, size, mosquito age, and the number of times each person was bitten. Of 3,677 engorged mosquitoes collected and 1,186 complete DNA profiles, only 420 meals matched people from the study area, indicating that Ae. aegypti feed on people moving transiently through communities to conduct daily business. 10-13\% of engorged mosquitoes fed on more than one person. No biting rate differences were detected between high- and low-dengue transmission seasons. We estimate that 43-46\% of engorged mosquitoes bit more than one person within each gonotrophic cycle. Most multiple meals were from residents of the mosquito collection house or neighbors. People \${\textbackslash}le\$ 25 years old were bitten less often than older people. Some hosts were fed on frequently, with three hosts bitten nine times. Interaction networks for mosquitoes and humans revealed biologically significant blood feeding hotspots, including community marketplaces. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE:High multiple-feeding rates and feeding on community visitors are likely important features in the efficient transmission and rapid spread of DENV. These results help explain why reducing vector populations alone is difficult for dengue prevention and support the argument for additional studies of mosquito feeding behavior, which when integrated with a greater understanding of human behavior will refine estimates of risk and strategies for dengue control.},

Here the impact of this approach upon human exposure to wild populations of vectors for both malaria and filariasis under full field conditions is assessed for the first time. METHODS:Transfluthrin-treated and untreated strips were placed around human volunteers conducting human landing catch in an outdoor environment in urban Dar es Salaam, where much human exposure to malaria and filariasis transmission occurs outdoors. The experiment was replicated 9 times at 16 outdoor catching stations in 4 distinct locations over 72 working nights between May and August 2012. RESULTS:Overall, the treated hessian strips conferred 99 \% protection against An. gambiae (1 bite versus 159) and 92 \% protection against Culex spp. (1478 bites versus 18,602). No decline in efficacy over the course of the study could be detected for the very sparse populations of An. gambiae (P = 0.32) and only a slow efficacy decline was observed for Culex spp. (P {\textless} 0.001), with protection remaining satisfactory over 3 months after strip treatment. Diversion of mosquitoes to unprotected humans in nearby houses was neither detected for An. gambiae (P = 0.152) nor for Culex spp. (Relative rate, [95 \% CI] = 1.03, [0.95, 1.11], P = 0.499). CONCLUSION:While this study raises more questions than it answers, the presented evidence of high protection over long periods suggest this technology may have potential for preventing outdoor transmission of malaria, lymphatic filariasis and other vector-borne pathogens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low levels of relative humidity are known to decrease the lifespan of mosquitoes. However, most current models of malaria transmission do not account for the effects of relative humidity on mosquito survival. In the Sahel, where relative humidity drops to levels {\textless}20\% for several months of the year, we expect relative humidity to play a significant role in shaping the seasonal profile of mosquito populations. Here, we present a new formulation for Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) mosquito survival as a function of temperature and relative humidity and investigate the effect of humidity on simulated mosquito populations. METHODS: Using existing observations on relationships between temperature, relative humidity and mosquito longevity, we developed a new equation for mosquito survival as a function of temperature and relative humidity. We collected simultaneous field observations on temperature, wind, relative humidity, and anopheline mosquito populations for two villages from the Sahel region of Africa, which are presented in this paper. We apply this equation to the environmental data and conduct numerical simulations of mosquito populations using the Hydrology, Entomology and Malaria Transmission Simulator (HYDREMATS). RESULTS: Relative humidity drops to levels that are uncomfortable for mosquitoes at the end of the rainy season. In one village, Banizoumbou, water pools dried up and interrupted mosquito breeding shortly after the end of the rainy season. In this case, relative humidity had little effect on the mosquito population. However, in the other village, Zindarou, the relatively shallow water table led to water pools that persisted several months beyond the end of the rainy season. In this case, the decrease in mosquito survival due to relative humidity improved the model's ability to reproduce the seasonal pattern of observed mosquito abundance. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a new equation to describe Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquito survival as a function of temperature and relative humidity. We demonstrated that relative humidity can play a significant role in mosquito population and malaria transmission dynamics. Future modeling work should account for these effects of relative humidity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The proportion of individuals who seek treatment for fever is an important quantity in understanding access to and use of health systems, as well as for interpreting data on disease incidence from routine surveillance systems. For many malaria endemic countries (MECs), treatment-seeking information is available from national household surveys. The aim of this paper was to assemble sub-national estimates of treatment-seeking behaviours and to predict national treatment-seeking measures for all MECs lacking household survey data. METHODS:Data on treatment seeking for fever were obtained from Demographic and Health Surveys, Malaria Indicator Surveys and Multiple Cluster Indicator Surveys for every MEC and year that data were available. National-level social, economic and health-related variables were gathered from the World Bank as putative covariates of treatment-seeking rates. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was used to estimate treatment-seeking behaviours for countries where survey data were unavailable. Two separate models were developed to predict the proportion of fever cases that would seek treatment at (1) a public health facility or (2) from any kind of treatment provider. RESULTS:Treatment-seeking data were available for 74 MECs and modelled for the remaining 24. GAMMs found that the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care, vaccination rates, education level, government health expenditure, and GDP growth were important predictors for both categories of treatment-seeking outcomes. Treatment-seeking rates, which varied both within and among regions, revealed that public facilities were not always the primary facility type used. CONCLUSIONS:Estimates of treatment-seeking rates show how health services are utilized and help correct reported malaria case numbers to obtain more accurate measures of disease burden. The assembled and modelled data demonstrated that while treatment-seeking rates have overall increased over time, access remains low in some malaria endemic regions and utilization of government services is in some areas limited.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Light microscopy examination of blood slides is the main method of detecting malaria infection; however, it has limited sensitivity. Low-density infections are most likely to be missed, but they contribute to the infectious reservoir. Quantifying these submicroscopic infections is therefore key to understanding transmission dynamics and successfully reducing parasite transmission. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of endemic population surveys in which P. falciparum prevalence had been measured by both microscopy and a more-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. The combined microscopy:PCR prevalence ratio was estimated by random-effects meta-analysis, and the effect of covariates was determined by meta-regression. RESULTS: Seventy-two pairs of prevalence measurements were included in the study. The prevalence of infection measured by microscopy was, on average, 50.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 45.2\%-57.1\%) of that measured by PCR. For gametocyte-specific detection, the microscopy prevalence was, on average, 8.7\% (95\% CI, 2.8\%-26.6\%) of the prevalence measured by PCR. A significantly higher percentage of total infections was detected by microscopy in areas of high, compared with low, transmission (74.5\% when the prevalence determined by PCR was {\textgreater}75\% versus 12.0\% when the prevalence determined by PCR was {\textless}10\%). DISCUSSION: Microscopy can miss a substantial proportion of P. falciparum infections in surveys of endemic populations, especially in areas with low transmission of infection. The extent of the submicroscopic reservoir needs to be taken into account for effective surveillance and control.},

Malaria transmission is perennial with Plasmodium falciparum, accounting for greater than 80\% of malaria cases. Transmission intensity varies with season with high transmission after the monsoon rains in autumn and winter, low transmission in summer, and intermediate transmission in spring. The anthropophagic mosquito Anopheles fluviatilis was identified as the main vector for malaria transmission. Based on observations of spleen rates and supported by data on malaria parasite prevalence and malaria incidence, San Dulakudar can be classified as a hyperendemic area for P. falciparum malaria. Parasite prevalence and malaria incidence rates decrease with age, suggesting that residents of San Dulakudar develop immunity to malaria. The study demonstrates the presence of regions in the Indian subcontinent such as Sundargarh District where P. falciparum is the primary cause of malaria and where malaria transmission rates are comparable to those found in many parts of Africa.},

TB kills two million people each year and foci of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have been identified in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A critical question for health policy is whether standardized short-course chemotherapy for TB, based on cheap first-line drugs, can prevent and reverse the spread of drug resistance. Here we use mathematical modeling, in conjunction with treatment results from six countries, to show that best-practice short-course chemotherapy is highly likely to bring strains resistant to either of the two key drugs isoniazid and rifampicin under control and to prevent the emergence of MDR-TB. However, it is not certain to contain MDR-TB once it has emerged, partly because cure rates are too low. We estimate that approximately 70\% of prevalent, infectious MDR-TB cases should be detected and treated each year, and at least 80\% of these cases should be cured, in order to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB. Poor control programs should aim to increase case detection and cure rates together for three reasons: (i) these variables act synergistically; (ii) when either is low, the other cannot succeed alone; and (iii) the second-line drugs needed to raise MDR-TB cure rates are few and extremely costly. We discuss the implications of these results for World Health Organization policy on the management of antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria still remains a public health problem in some districts of Bhutan despite marked reduction of cases in last few years. To strengthen the country's prevention and control measures, this study was carried out to develop forecasting and prediction models of malaria incidence in the endemic districts of Bhutan using time series and ARIMAX. METHODS: This study was carried out retrospectively using the monthly reported malaria cases from the health centres to Vector-borne Disease Control Programme (VDCP) and the meteorological data from Meteorological Unit, Department of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs. Time series analysis was performed on monthly malaria cases, from 1994 to 2008, in seven malaria endemic districts. The time series models derived from a multiplicative seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) was deployed to identify the best model using data from 1994 to 2006. The best-fit model was selected for each individual district and for the overall endemic area was developed and the monthly cases from January to December 2009 and 2010 were forecasted. In developing the prediction model, the monthly reported malaria cases and the meteorological factors from 1996 to 2008 of the seven districts were analysed. The method of ARIMAX modelling was employed to determine predictors of malaria of the subsequent month. RESULTS: It was found that the ARIMA (p, d, q) (P, D, Q)s model (p and P representing the auto regressive and seasonal autoregressive; d and D representing the non-seasonal differences and seasonal differencing; and q and Q the moving average parameters and seasonal moving average parameters, respectively and s representing the length of the seasonal period) for the overall endemic districts was (2,1,1)(0,1,1)12; the modelling data from each district revealed two most common ARIMA models including (2,1,1)(0,1,1)12 and (1,1,1)(0,1,1)12. The forecasted monthly malaria cases from January to December 2009 and 2010 varied from 15 to 82 cases in 2009 and 67 to 149 cases in 2010, where population in 2009 was 285,375 and the expected population of 2010 to be 289,085. The ARIMAX model of monthly cases and climatic factors showed considerable variations among the different districts. In general, the mean maximum temperature lagged at one month was a strong positive predictor of an increased malaria cases for four districts. The monthly number of cases of the previous month was also a significant predictor in one district, whereas no variable could predict malaria cases for two districts. CONCLUSIONS: The ARIMA models of time-series analysis were useful in forecasting the number of cases in the endemic areas of Bhutan. There was no consistency in the predictors of malaria cases when using ARIMAX model with selected lag times and climatic predictors. The ARIMA forecasting models could be employed for planning and managing malaria prevention and control programme in Bhutan.},

	abstract = {Malaria not only remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, but it also impedes socioeconomic development, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Rapid and unprecedented urbanization, going hand-in-hand with often declining economies, might have profound implications for the epidemiology and control of malaria, as the relative disease burden increases among urban dwellers. Reviewing the literature and using a modeling approach, we find that entomologic inoculation rates in cities range from 0 to 54 per year, depending on the degree of urbanization, the spatial location within a city, and overall living conditions. Using the latest United Nations figures on urbanization prospects, nighttime light remotely sensed images, and the “Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa” results on climate suitability for stable malaria transmission, we estimate that 200 million people (24.6\% of the total African population) currently live in urban settings where they are at risk of contracting the disease. Importantly, the estimated total surface area covered by these urban settings is only approximately 1.1-1.6\% of the total African surface. Considering different plausible scenarios, we estimate an annual incidence of 24.8-103.2 million cases of clinical malaria attacks among urban dwellers in Africa. These figures translate to 6-28\% of the estimated global annual disease incidence. Against this background, basic health care delivery systems providing early diagnosis and early treatment and preventive actions through mother and child health programs and the promotion of insecticide-treated bed nets for the rapidly growing numbers of the urban poor must be improved alongside well-tailored and integrated malaria control strategies. We propose environmental management and larviciding within well-specified productive sites as a main feature for such an integrated control approach. Mitigation of the current burden of malaria in urban African settings, in turn, is a necessity for stimulating environmentally and socially sustainable development.},

The many definitions and concepts of animal migration are debated, and instances of so-called mosquito migration, that is long distance wind-assisted flights, and the ecological advantages and disadvantages of such journeys are examined. It is concluded that there is little evidence that mosquitoes make purposeful long distance flights that can be classified zoologically as migration. It is argued that it is better to regard all mosquito flights as dispersal. Host orientation cues are not discussed, but the contentious idea of a memorized home range between feeding and oviposition sites is presented.},

	abstract = {Malaria vectors which predominantly feed indoors upon humans have been locally eliminated from several settings with insecticide treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying or larval source management. Recent dramatic declines of An. gambiae in east Africa with imperfect ITN coverage suggest mosquito populations can rapidly collapse when forced below realistically achievable, non-zero thresholds of density and supporting resource availability. Here we explain why insecticide-based mosquito elimination strategies are feasible, desirable and can be extended to a wider variety of species by expanding the vector control arsenal to cover a broader spectrum of the resources they need to survive. The greatest advantage of eliminating mosquitoes, rather than merely controlling them, is that this precludes local selection for behavioural or physiological resistance traits. The greatest challenges are therefore to achieve high biological coverage of targeted resources rapidly enough to prevent local emergence of resistance and to then continually exclude, monitor for and respond to re-invasion from external populations.},

The strategies produced through this framework are adaptive: vaccination schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter estimates. CONCLUSIONS:Using simulation studies based on a classic influenza outbreak, we demonstrate the advantages of adaptive interventions over non-adaptive ones, in terms of cost and resource efficiency, and robustness to model misspecification.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Partial mosquito-proofing of houses with screens and ceilings has the potential to reduce indoor densities of malaria mosquitoes. We wish to measure whether it will also reduce indoor densities of vectors of neglected tropical diseases. METHODOLOGY: The main house entry points preferred by anopheline and culicine vectors were determined through controlled experiments using specially designed experimental huts and village houses in Lupiro village, southern Tanzania. The benefit of screening different entry points (eaves, windows and doors) using PVC-coated fibre glass netting material in terms of reduced indoor densities of mosquitoes was evaluated compared to the control. FINDINGS: 23,027 mosquitoes were caught with CDC light traps; 77.9\% (17,929) were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, of which 66.2\% were An. arabiensis and 33.8\% An. gambiae sensu stricto. The remainder comprised 0.2\% (50) An. funestus, 10.2\% (2359) Culex spp. and 11.6\% (2664) Mansonia spp. Screening eaves reduced densities of Anopheles gambiae s. l. (Relative ratio (RR) = 0.91; 95\% CI = 0.84, 0.98; P = 0.01); Mansonia africana (RR = 0.43; 95\% CI = 0.26, 0.76; P{\textless}0.001) and Mansonia uniformis (RR = 0.37; 95\% CI = 0.25, 0.56; P{\textless}0.001) but not Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. univittatus or Cx. theileri. Numbers of these species were reduced by screening windows and doors but this was not significant. SIGNIFICANCE: This study confirms that across Africa, screening eaves protects households against important mosquito vectors of filariasis, Rift Valley Fever and O'Nyong nyong as well as malaria. While full house screening is required to exclude Culex species mosquitoes, screening of eaves alone or fitting ceilings has considerable potential for integrated control of other vectors of filariasis, arbovirus and malaria.},

In this paper, we develop and simulate a discrete-space continuous-time mathematical model to investigate the impact of dispersal and heterogeneous distribution of resources on the distribution and dynamics of mosquito populations. We build an ordinary differential equation model of the mosquito life cycle and replicate it across a hexagonal grid (multi-patch system) that represents two-dimensional space. We use the model to estimate mosquito dispersal distances and to evaluate the effect of spatial repellents as a vector control strategy. We find evidence of association between heterogeneity, dispersal, spatial distribution of resources, and mosquito population dynamics. Random distribution of repellents reduces the distance moved by mosquitoes, offering a promising strategy for disease control.},

Faced with this inadequacy, vital public health decisions often rely on crudely adjusted regional and national estimates of treatment burdens. METHODS AND FINDINGS:This study has taken the example of presumed malaria in outpatients within the largely incomplete Kenyan HMIS database and has defined a geostatistical modelling framework that can predict values for all data that are missing through space and time. The resulting complete set can then be used to define treatment burdens for presumed malaria at any level of spatial and temporal aggregation. Validation of the model has shown that these burdens are quantified to an acceptable level of accuracy at the district, provincial, and national scale. CONCLUSIONS:The modelling framework presented here provides, to our knowledge for the first time, reliable information from imperfect HMIS data to support evidence-based decision-making at national and sub-national levels.},

The result of the calculation was displayed globally on a 0.5 degrees grid.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The significance of malaria transmission occurring outdoors has risen even in areas where indoor interventions such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying are common. The actual contamination rates and effectiveness of recently developed outdoor mosquito control device, the mosquito landing box (MLB), on densities and daily survival of host-seeking laboratory Anopheles arabiensis, which readily bites humans outdoors was demonstrated. METHODS:Experiments were conducted in large semi-field systems (SFS) with human volunteers inside, to mimic natural ecosystems, and using MLBs baited with natural or synthetic human odours and carbon dioxide. The MLBs were dusted with 10\% pyriproxyfen (PPF) or entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium anisopliae) spores to mark mosquitoes physically contacting the devices. Each night, 400 laboratory-reared An. arabiensis females were released in one SFS chamber with two MLBs, and another chamber without MLBs (control). Mosquitoes were individually recaptured while attempting to bite volunteers inside SFS or by aspiration from SFS walls. Mosquitoes from chambers with PPF-treated MLBs and respective controls were individually dipped in water-filled cups containing ten conspecific third-instar larvae, whose subsequent development was monitored. Mosquitoes recaptured from chambers with fungi-treated MLBs were observed for fungal hyphal growth on their cadavers. Separately, effects on daily survival were determined by exposing An. arabiensis in chambers having MLBs treated with 5\% pirimiphos methyl compared to chambers without MLBs (control), after which the mosquitoes were recaptured and monitored individually until they died. RESULTS:Up to 63\% (152/240) and 43\% (92/210) of mosquitoes recaptured inside treatment chambers were contaminated with pyriproxyfen and M. anisopliae, respectively, compared to 8\% (19/240) and 0\% (0/164) in controls. The mean number of larvae emerging from cups in which adults from chambers with PPF-treated MLBs were dipped was significantly lower [0.75 (0.50-1.01)], than in controls [28.79 (28.32-29.26)], P {\textless} 0.001). Daily survival of mosquitoes exposed to 5\% pirimiphos methyl was nearly two-fold lower than controls [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.748 (1.551-1.920), P {\textless} 0.001]. CONCLUSION:High contamination rates in exposed mosquitoes even in presence of humans, demonstrates potential of MLBs for controlling outdoor-biting malaria vectors, either by reducing their survival or directly killing host-seeking mosquitoes. The MLBs also have potential for dispensing filial infanticides, such as PPF, which mosquitoes can transmit to their aquatic habitats for mosquito population control.},

Expenditures in two districts for two years–2004 and 2009–were compiled. FINDINGS: Malaria incidence in Sri Lanka has declined by 99.9\% since 1999. During this time, there were increases in the proportion of malaria infections due to Plasmodium vivax, and the proportion of infections occurring in adult males. Indoor residual spraying and distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets have likely contributed to the low transmission. Entomological surveillance was maintained. A strong passive case detection system captures infections and active case detection was introduced. When comparing conflict and non-conflict districts, vector control and surveillance measures were maintained in conflict areas, often with higher coverage reported in conflict districts. One of two districts in the study reported a 48\% decline in malaria programme expenditure per person at risk from 2004 to 2009. The other district had stable malaria spending. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Malaria is now at low levels in Sri Lanka–124 indigenous cases were found in 2011. The majority of infections occur in adult males and are due to P. vivax. Evidence-driven policy and an ability to adapt to new circumstances contributed to this decline. Malaria interventions were maintained in the conflict districts despite an ongoing war. Sri Lanka has set a goal of eliminating malaria by the end of 2014. Early identification and treatment of infections, especially imported ones, together with effective surveillance and response, will be critical to achieving this goal.},

	abstract = {A successful short-term solution to transmission of AIDS in Western Africa by migrants involves provision of accessible and acceptable basic health and social services to migrants at their destination. The aim is to establish a sense of security and community, which is a health requirement. When migrants are excluded from community life or victimized as carriers of HIV infections, they will be driven by basic survival needs and dysfunctional social organization, which results in the rapid spread of HIV. Closing borders and mass deportation may not be an option. The long-term solution is population policy, environmental protection, and economic development. The focus on mapping the spread of AIDS must shift to a consideration of the migrant social conditions that make them vulnerable to AIDS. The issue of migration and AIDS will be addressed at the First European Conference on Tropical Medicine in October 1995 in Hamburg, Germany. In Uganda, HIV seroprevalence rates ranged from 5.5\% among the stable population to 12.4\% among internal migrants moving between villages to 16.3\% among migrants from other areas. A World Bank project is operating in Western Africa, which traces seasonal male migration from the Cameroon to Liberia, Senegal to Nigeria, and from the Sahel to the coast during dry seasons. National border rules may influence the routes but not the extent of migration. A major destination place is Cote d' Ivoire, which has 25\% of total population comprised of migrants from other countries and one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in Western Africa. On plantations prostitutes are brought in. Each prostitute serves about 25 workers. The pattern of sexual mixing contributes to the high HIV rates. Female migration is smaller and usually concentrated in prostitution at place of destination. Illiteracy and poverty drive women migrants into the trade. Their frequent health problems are malaria, pelvic pain, menstrual irregularity, vaginal discharge, and genital sores. Drugs are bought on the streets or from friends and may be of questionable efficacy. Health services may be sought upon return to the home country.},

OBJECTIVE:The study was conducted to assess caregivers'practice related to the treatment of childhood malaria. METHODS:The study was conducted in 9 Kebeles surrounding Gilgel Gibe Dam from November to December 2005 employing a cross-sectional design. A sample of 588 households in which children between the age of 2 months and 59 months resided were randomly selected from urban, semi urban and rural strata. The primary caregivers in each sampled households were interviewed using structured questionnaire. FINDINGS:Most (79.2\%) of the caregivers reported that their under five child has been affected by malaria at least once in their lifetime. The common first modalities of treatment for the child's last malarial episode were home treatment (52.3\%) and treatment seeking from formal sectors (43.7\%). The commonest type of home care was treatment with antimalarials (71.3\%). Early treatment seeking was higher among those who started home antimalarial treatment (30\%) as compared to those who sought treatment from formal sectors (19.7\%). Higher socioeconomic status was found to be associated with early treatment seeking. CONCLUSION:The study has identified high prevalence of home treatment with antimalarials and late onset of treatment seeking by caregivers for children with malaria. This lays a good ground and calls for implementation of home malaria management strategy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Prior studies have shown that annual entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) must be reduced to less than one to substantially reduce the prevalence of malaria infection. In this study, EIR values were used to quantify the impact of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and source reduction (SR) on malaria transmission. The analysis of EIR was extended through determining whether available vector control tools can ultimately eradicate malaria. METHOD:The analysis is based primarily on a review of all controlled studies that used ITN, IRS, and/or SR and reported their effects on the EIR. To compare EIRs between studies, the percent difference in EIR between the intervention and control groups was calculated. RESULTS:Eight vector control intervention studies that measured EIR were found: four ITN studies, one IRS study, one SR study, and two studies with separate ITN and IRS intervention groups. In both the Tanzania study and the Solomon Islands study, one community received ITNs and one received IRS. In the second year of the Tanzania study, EIR was 90\% lower in the ITN community and 93\% lower in the IRS community, relative to the community without intervention; the ITN and IRS effects were not significantly different. In contrast, in the Solomon Islands study, EIR was 94\% lower in the ITN community and 56\% lower in the IRS community. The one SR study, in Dar es Salaam, reported a lower EIR reduction (47\%) than the ITN and IRS studies. All of these vector control interventions reduced EIR, but none reduced it to zero. CONCLUSION:These studies indicate that current vector control methods alone cannot ultimately eradicate malaria because no intervention sustained an annual EIR less than one. While researchers develop new tools, integrated vector management may make the greatest impact on malaria transmission. There are many gaps in the entomological malaria literature and recommendations for future research are provided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The expansion of global travel has resulted in the importation of African Anopheles mosquitoes, giving rise to cases of local malaria transmission. Here, cases of 'airport malaria' are used to quantify, using a combination of global climate and air traffic volume, where and when are the greatest risks of a Plasmodium falciparum-carrying mosquito being importated by air. This prioritises areas at risk of further airport malaria and possible importation or reemergence of the disease. METHODS:Monthly data on climate at the World's major airports were combined with air traffic information and African malaria seasonality maps to identify, month-by-month, those existing and future air routes at greatest risk of African malaria-carrying mosquito importation and temporary establishment. RESULTS:The location and timing of recorded airport malaria cases proved predictable using a combination of climate and air traffic data. Extending the analysis beyond the current air network architecture enabled identification of the airports and months with greatest climatic similarity to P. falciparum endemic regions of Africa within their principal transmission seasons, and therefore at risk should new aviation routes become operational. CONCLUSION:With the growth of long haul air travel from Africa, the identification of the seasonality and routes of mosquito importation is important in guiding effective aircraft disinsection and vector control. The recent and continued addition of air routes from Africa to more climatically similar regions than Europe will increase movement risks. The approach outlined here is capable of identifying when and where these risks are greatest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The ability of mosquitoes to evade fatal exposure to insecticidal nets and sprays represents the primary obstacle to eliminating malaria. However, it remains unclear which behaviours are most important for buffering mosquito and parasite populations against vector control. METHODS:Simulated life histories were used to compare the impact of alternative feeding behaviour strategies upon overall lifetime feeding success, and upon temporal distributions of successful feeds and biting rates experienced by unprotected humans, in the presence and absence of insecticidal nets. Strictly nocturnal preferred feeding times were contrasted with 1) a wider preference window extending to dawn and dusk, and 2) crepuscular preferences wherein foraging is suppressed when humans sleep and can use nets but is maximal immediately before and after. Simulations with diversion and mortality parameters typical of endophagic, endophilic African vectors, such as Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus, were compared with those for endophagic but exophilic species, such as Anopheles arabiensis, that also enter houses but leave earlier before lethal exposure to insecticide-treated surfaces occurs. RESULTS:Insecticidal nets were predicted to redistribute successful feeding events to dawn and dusk where these were included in the profile of innately preferred feeding times. However, predicted distributions of biting unprotected humans were unaffected because extended host-seeking activity was redistributed to innately preferred feeding times. Recently observed alterations of biting activity distributions therefore reflect processes not captured in this model, such as evolutionary selection of heritably modified feeding time preferences or phenotypically plastic expression of feeding time preference caused by associative learning. Surprisingly, endophagy combined with exophily, among mosquitoes that enter houses but then feed and/or rest briefly before rapidly exiting, consistently attenuated predicted insecticide impact more than any feeding time preference trait. CONCLUSIONS:Regardless of underlying cause, recent redistributions of host-biting activity to dawn and dusk necessitate new outdoor control strategies. However, persistently indoor-feeding vectors, that evade intradomiciliary insecticide exposure, are at least equally important. Fortunately, recent evaluations of occupied houses or odour-baited stations, with baffled entrances that retain An. arabiensis within insecticide-treated structures, illustrate how endophagic but exophilic vectors may be more effectively tackled using existing insecticides.},

	doi = {10.1186/1475-2875-12-61},
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: As successful malaria control programmes move towards elimination, they must identify residual transmission foci, target vector control to high-risk areas, focus on both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, and manage importation risk. High spatial and temporal resolution maps of malaria risk can support all of these activities, but commonly available malaria maps are based on parasite rate, a poor metric for measuring malaria at extremely low prevalence. New approaches are required to provide case-based risk maps to countries seeking to identify remaining hotspots of transmission while managing the risk of transmission from imported cases. METHODS: Household locations and travel histories of confirmed malaria patients during 2011 were recorded through routine surveillance by the Swaziland National Malaria Control Programme for the higher transmission months of January to April and the lower transmission months of May to December. Household locations for patients with no travel history to endemic areas were compared against a random set of background points sampled proportionate to population density with respect to a set of variables related to environment, population density, vector control, and distance to the locations of identified imported cases. Comparisons were made separately for the high and low transmission seasons. The Random Forests regression tree classification approach was used to generate maps predicting the probability of a locally acquired case at 100 m resolution across Swaziland for each season. RESULTS: Results indicated that case households during the high transmission season tended to be located in areas of lower elevation, closer to bodies of water, in more sparsely populated areas, with lower rainfall and warmer temperatures, and closer to imported cases than random background points (all p {\textless} 0.001). Similar differences were evident during the low transmission season. Maps from the fit models suggested better predictive ability during the high season. Both models proved useful at predicting the locations of local cases identified in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: The high-resolution mapping approaches described here can help elimination programmes understand the epidemiology of a disappearing disease. Generating case-based risk maps at high spatial and temporal resolution will allow control programmes to direct interventions proactively according to evidence-based measures of risk and ensure that the impact of limited resources is maximized to achieve and maintain malaria elimination.},

Mathematical models were fit to data collected between 1990 and the start of vector control in 2008. Results show that asexual parasite slide prevalence in humans has reduced from 70 to 20\%, but that the proportion of infectious mosquitoes has remained roughly constant. Evidence suggests that this is due to an increase in transmission efficiency caused by a rise in gametocyte densities, although the uneven distribution of mosquito bites between hosts could also contribute. The resilience of mosquito infection to changes in endemicity will have important implications for planning disease control, and the development and deployment of transmission-reducing interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Zambian Malaria Control Programme with the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partners have developed the current National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP 2006-2011) which focuses on prevention based on the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) strategy. The introduction and implementation of an IVM strategy was planned in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) steps towards IVM implementation namely Introduction Phase, Consolidation Phase and Expansion Phase. ACHIEVEMENTS: IVM has created commitment for Legal and Regulatory policy review, monitoring, Research and a strong stewardship by the chemical suppliers. It has also leveraged additional resources, improved inter-sectoral collaboration, capacity building and enhanced community participation which facilitated a steady scaling up in coverage and utilisation of key preventive interventions. Thus, markedly reducing malaria incidence and case fatalities in the country. CONCLUSION: Zambia has successfully introduced, consolidated and expanded IVM activities. Resulting in increased coverage and utilization of interventions and markedly reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality while ensuring a better protection of the environment.},

	abstract = {Current evidence suggests that inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability have a direct influence on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. This evidence has been assessed at the continental level in order to determine the possible consequences of the expected future climate change. By 2100 it is estimated that average global temperatures will have risen by 1.0-3.5 degrees C, increasing the likelihood of many vector-borne diseases in new areas. The greatest effect of climate change on transmission is likely to be observed at the extremes of the range of temperatures at which transmission occurs. For many diseases these lie in the range 14-18 degrees C at the lower end and about 35-40 degrees C at the upper end. Malaria and dengue fever are among the most important vector-borne diseases in the tropics and subtropics; Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the USA and Europe. Encephalitis is also becoming a public health concern. Health risks due to climatic changes will differ between countries that have developed health infrastructures and those that do not. Human settlement patterns in the different regions will influence disease trends. While 70\% of the population in South America is urbanized, the proportion in sub-Saharan Africa is less than 45\%. Climatic anomalies associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon and resulting in drought and floods are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. They have been linked to outbreaks of malaria in Africa, Asia and South America. Climate change has far-reaching consequences and touches on all life-support systems. It is therefore a factor that should be placed high among those that affect human health and survival.},

	abstract = {It is extremely likely that the malaria vaccines currently in development will be used in conjunction with treated bednets and other forms of malaria control. The interaction of different intervention methods is at present poorly understood in a disease such as malaria where immunity is more complex than for other pathogens that have been successfully controlled by vaccination. Here we develop a general mathematical model of malaria transmission to examine the interaction between vaccination and bednets. Counterintuitively, we find that the frailty of malaria immunity will potentially cause both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between vaccination and the use of bednets. We explore the conditions that create these tensions, and outline strategies that minimize their detrimental impact. Our analysis specifically considers the three leading vaccine classes currently in development: preerythrocytic (PEV), blood stage (BSV), and transmission blocking (TBV). We find that the combination of BSV with treated bednets can lead to increased morbidity with no added value in terms of elimination; the interaction is clearly antagonistic. In contrast, there is strong synergy between PEV and treated bednets that may facilitate elimination, although transient stages are likely to increase morbidity. The combination of TBV with treated bednets is synergistic, lowering both morbidity and elimination thresholds. Our results suggest that vaccines will not provide a straightforward solution to malaria control, and that future programs need to consider the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between vaccines and treated bednets.},

	abstract = {Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a potentially pathogenic inherited enzyme abnormality and, similar to other human red blood cell polymorphisms, is particularly prevalent in historically malaria endemic countries. The spatial extent of Plasmodium vivax malaria overlaps widely with that of G6PD deficiency; unfortunately the only drug licensed for the radical cure and relapse prevention of P. vivax, primaquine, can trigger severe haemolytic anaemia in G6PD deficient individuals. This chapter reviews the past and current data on this unique pharmacogenetic association, which is becoming increasingly important as several nations now consider strategies to eliminate malaria transmission rather than control its clinical burden. G6PD deficiency is a highly variable disorder, in terms of spatial heterogeneity in prevalence and molecular variants, as well as its interactions with P. vivax and primaquine. Consideration of factors including aspects of basic physiology, diagnosis, and clinical triggers of primaquine-induced haemolysis is required to assess the risks and benefits of applying primaquine in various geographic and demographic settings. Given that haemolytically toxic antirelapse drugs will likely be the only therapeutic options for the coming decade, it is clear that we need to understand in depth G6PD deficiency and primaquine-induced haemolysis to determine safe and effective therapeutic strategies to overcome this hurdle and achieve malaria elimination.},

	abstract = {While malaria transmission varies seasonally, large inter-annual heterogeneity of malaria incidence occurs. Variability in entomological parameters, biting rates and entomological inoculation rates (EIR) have been strongly associated with attack rates in children. The goal of this study was to assess the weather's impact on weekly biting and EIR in the endemic area of Kisian, Kenya. Entomological data collected by the U.S. Army from March 1986 through June 1988 at Kisian, Kenya was analysed with concurrent weather data from nearby Kisumu airport. A soil moisture model of surface-water availability was used to combine multiple weather parameters with landcover and soil features to improve disease prediction. Modelling soil moisture substantially improved prediction of biting rates compared to rainfall; soil moisture lagged two weeks explained up to 45\% of An. gambiae biting variability, compared to 8\% for raw precipitation. For An. funestus, soil moisture explained 32\% variability, peaking after a 4-week lag. The interspecies difference in response to soil moisture was significant (P {\textless} 0.00001). A satellite normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) of the study site yielded a similar correlation (r = 0.42 An. gambiae). Modelled soil moisture accounted for up to 56\% variability of An. gambiae EIR, peaking at a lag of six weeks. The relationship between temperature and An. gambiae biting rates was less robust; maximum temperature r2 = -0.20, and minimum temperature r2 = 0.12 after lagging one week. Benefits of hydrological modelling are compared to raw weather parameters and to satellite NDVI. These findings can improve both current malaria risk assessments and those based on El Niño forecasts or global climate change model projections.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This is the second in a series of three articles documenting the geographical distribution of 41 dominant vector species (DVS) of human malaria. The first paper addressed the DVS of the Americas and the third will consider those of the Asian Pacific Region. Here, the DVS of Africa, Europe and the Middle East are discussed. The continent of Africa experiences the bulk of the global malaria burden due in part to the presence of the An. gambiae complex. Anopheles gambiae is one of four DVS within the An. gambiae complex, the others being An. arabiensis and the coastal An. merus and An. melas. There are a further three, highly anthropophilic DVS in Africa, An. funestus, An. moucheti and An. nili. Conversely, across Europe and the Middle East, malaria transmission is low and frequently absent, despite the presence of six DVS. To help control malaria in Africa and the Middle East, or to identify the risk of its re-emergence in Europe, the contemporary distribution and bionomics of the relevant DVS are needed. RESULTS: A contemporary database of occurrence data, compiled from the formal literature and other relevant resources, resulted in the collation of information for seven DVS from 44 countries in Africa containing 4234 geo-referenced, independent sites. In Europe and the Middle East, six DVS were identified from 2784 geo-referenced sites across 49 countries. These occurrence data were combined with expert opinion ranges and a suite of environmental and climatic variables of relevance to anopheline ecology to produce predictive distribution maps using the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) method. CONCLUSIONS: The predicted geographic extent for the following DVS (or species/suspected species complex*) is provided for Africa: Anopheles (Cellia) arabiensis, An. (Cel.) funestus*, An.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eliminating malaria requires vector control interventions that dramatically reduce adult mosquito population densities and survival rates. Indoor applications of insecticidal nets and sprays are effective against an important minority of mosquito species that rely heavily upon human blood and habitations for survival. However, complementary approaches are needed to tackle a broader diversity of less human-specialized vectors by killing them at other resource targets. METHODS: Impacts of strategies that target insecticides to humans or animals can be rationalized in terms of biological coverage of blood resources, quantified as proportional coverage of all blood resources mosquito vectors utilize. Here, this concept is adapted to enable impact prediction for diverse vector control strategies based on measurements of utilization rates for any definable, targetable resource subset, even if that overall resource is not quantifiable. RESULTS: The usefulness of this approach is illustrated by deriving utilization rate estimates for various blood, resting site, and sugar resource subsets from existing entomological survey data. Reported impacts of insecticidal nets upon human-feeding vectors, and insecticide-treated livestock upon animal-feeding vectors, are approximately consistent with model predictions based on measured utilization rates for those human and animal blood resource subsets. Utilization rates for artificial sugar baits compare well with blood resources, and are consistent with observed impact when insecticide is added. While existing data was used to indirectly measure utilization rates for a variety of resting site subsets, by comparison with measured rates of blood resource utilization in the same settings, current techniques for capturing resting mosquitoes underestimate this quantity, and reliance upon complex models with numerous input parameters may limit the applicability of this approach. CONCLUSIONS: While blood and sugar consumption can be readily quantified using existing methods for detecting natural markers or artificial tracers, improved techniques for labelling mosquitoes, or other arthropod pathogen vectors, will be required to assess vector control measures which target them when they utilize non-nutritional resources such as resting, oviposition, and mating sites.},

By use of massively parallel pyrosequencing, we evaluated the diversity of CS haplotypes across the T-cell epitopes in parasites from Lilongwe, Malawi. We identified 57 unique parasite haplotypes from 100 participants. By use of ecological and molecular indexes of diversity, we saw no difference in the diversity of CS haplotypes between adults and children. We saw evidence of weak variant-specific selection within this region of CS, suggesting naturally acquired immunity does induce variant-specific selection on CS.

	abstract = {The emergence of Anopheles species resistant to insecticides widely used in vector control has the potential to impact directly on the control of malaria. This may have a particularly dramatic effect in Africa, where pyrethroids impregnated onto bed-nets are the dominant insecticides used for vector control. Because the same insecticides are used for crop pests, the extensive use and misuse of insecticides for agriculture has contributed to the resistance problem in some vectors. The potential for resistance to develop in African vectors has been apparent since the 1950s, but the scale of the problem has been poorly documented. A geographical information system-based decision support system for malaria control has recently been established in Africa and used operationally in Mozambique. The system incorporates climate data and disease transmission rates, but to date it has not incorporated spatial or temporal data on vector abundance or insecticide resistance. As a first step in incorporating this information, available published data on insecticide resistance in Africa has now been collated and incorporated into this decision support system. Data also are incorporated onto the openly available Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa (MARA) Web site (http://www.mara.org.za). New data, from a range of vector population-monitoring initiatives, can now be incorporated into this open access database to allow a spatial understanding of resistance distribution and its potential impact on disease transmission to benefit vector control programs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Removal of exhaled air from total body emanations or artificially standardising carbon dioxide (CO2) outputs has previously been shown to eliminate differential attractiveness of humans to certain blackfly (Simuliidae) and mosquito (Culicidae) species. Whether or not breath contributes to between-person differences in relative attractiveness to the highly anthropophilic malaria vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto remains unknown and was the focus of the present study. METHODS: The contribution to and possible interaction of breath (BR) and body odours (BO) in the attraction of An. gambiae s.s. to humans was investigated by conducting dual choice tests using a recently developed olfactometer. Either one or two human subjects were used as bait. The single person experiments compared the attractiveness of a person's BR versus that person's BO or a control (empty tent with no odour). His BO and total emanations (TE = BR+BO) were also compared with a control. The two-person experiments compared the relative attractiveness of their TE, BO or BR, and the TE of each person against the BO of the other. RESULTS: Experiments with one human subject (P1) as bait found that his BO and TE collected more mosquitoes than the control (P = 0.005 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively), as did his BO and the control versus his BR (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.034, respectively). The TE of P1 attracted more mosquitoes than that of another person designated P8 (P {\textless} 0.021), whereas the BR of P8 attracted more mosquitoes than the BR of P1 (P = 0.001). The attractiveness of the BO of P1 versus the BO of P8 did not differ (P = 0.346). The BO from either individual was consistently more attractive than the TE from the other (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated for the first time that human breath, although known to contain semiochemicals that elicit behavioural and/or electrophysiological responses (CO2, ammonia, fatty acids) in An. gambiae also contains one or more constituents with allomonal ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilderepellent) properties, which inhibit attraction and may serve as an important contributor to between-person differences in the relative attractiveness of humans to this important malaria vector.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Rainfall variability and associated remote sensing indices for vegetation are central to the development of early warning systems for epidemic malaria in arid regions. The considerable change in land-use practices resulting from increasing irrigation in recent decades raises important questions on concomitant change in malaria dynamics and its coupling to climate forcing. Here, the consequences of irrigation level for malaria epidemics are addressed with extensive time series data for confirmed Plasmodium falciparum monthly cases, spanning over two decades for five districts in north-west India. The work specifically focuses on the response of malaria epidemics to rainfall forcing and how this response is affected by increasing irrigation. METHODS AND FINDINGS:Remote sensing data for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are used as an integrated measure of rainfall to examine correlation maps within the districts and at regional scales. The analyses specifically address whether irrigation has decreased the coupling between malaria incidence and climate variability, and whether this reflects (1) a breakdown of NDVI as a useful indicator of risk, (2) a weakening of rainfall forcing and a concomitant decrease in epidemic risk, or (3) an increase in the control of malaria transmission. The predictive power of NDVI is compared against that of rainfall, using simple linear models and wavelet analysis to study the association of NDVI and malaria variability in the time and in the frequency domain respectively. CONCLUSIONS:The results show that irrigation dampens the influence of climate forcing on the magnitude and frequency of malaria epidemics and, therefore, reduces their predictability. At low irrigation levels, this decoupling reflects a breakdown of local but not regional NDVI as an indicator of rainfall forcing. At higher levels of irrigation, the weakened role of climate variability may be compounded by increased levels of control; nevertheless this leads to no significant decrease in the actual risk of disease. This implies that irrigation can lead to more endemic conditions for malaria, creating the potential for unexpectedly large epidemics in response to excess rainfall if these climatic events coincide with a relaxation of control over time. The implications of our findings for control policies of epidemic malaria in arid regions are discussed.},

	abstract = {The generation reproduction number, R0, is the fundamental parameter of population biology. Communicable disease epidemiology has adopted R0 as the threshold parameter, called the basic case reproduction number (or ratio). In deterministic models, R0 must be greater than 1 for a pathogen to persist in its host population. Some standard methods of estimating R0 for an endemic disease require measures of incidence, and the theory underpinning these estimators assumes that incidence is constant through time. When transmission varies periodically (e.g., seasonally), as it does for most pathogens, it should be possible to express the criterion for long-term persistence in terms of some average transmission (and hence incidence) rate. A priori, there are reasons to believe that either the arithmetic mean or the geometric mean transmission rate may be correct. By considering the problem in terms of the real-time growth rate of the population, we are able to demonstrate formally that, to a very good approximation, the arithmetic mean transmission rate gives the correct answer for a general class of infection functions. The geometric mean applies only to a highly restricted set of cases. The appropriate threshold parameter can be calculated from the average transmission rate, and we discuss ways of doing so in the context of an endemic vector-borne disease, canine leishmaniasis.},

This course of events has been the subject of various mathematical models. In this paper we propose a new mathematical model for the in-host asexual erythrocytic development of P. falciparum malaria. Synchronicity of the infection is shown to be an inherent feature of infection, irrespective of the duration of merozoite release from the liver. It will, therefore, cause periodic symptoms, as known in malaria patients. We also simulate the effects of an induced host immune response and show how the level of immunity affects the development of disease. The simulations fit well with the clinical observations. We show how infection can become asynchronous and discuss the effect of desynchronization on the circulating and total parasitaemia and demonstrate that synchronized broods will show parasitaemia fluctuations.

	abstract = {Spatial differences in mortality have been reported in Africa amongst children under-five years of age. Risk factors contributing to this geographical variation include bio-demographic and socio-economic factors, the prevalence of infectious diseases and the variability in the quality of child health care. This paper is concerned with investigating the link between early childhood mortality and malaria risk. We used data from the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa (MARA) and Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) databases to explore this relationship. The DHS survey included questions on bio-demographic and socio-economic status, complete birth histories and survival time of each child within the five years preceding the survey. Survival times were computed in months until death or until the survey was done. The malaria risk was based on prevalence data estimated at the precise DHS sampling location. A spatial Cox regression model was applied to analyze child survival, assessing the influence of both individual-specific factors, malaria endemicity and group-specific environmental factors, approximated by geographical location. Geographical location was considered at subdistrict level. Our analysis shows that although malaria endemicity is not associated with the risk of infant mortality, it is an important risk factor for child mortality. The results confirm the effects of bio-demographic and socio-economic variables (maternal education, maternal age, birth order and place of residence) on infant and child mortality. The subdistrict-specific variation of infant and child mortality shows a rural-urban distinction with a relatively lower risk of mortality in main urban areas.},

	abstract = {Protecting individuals and households against mosquito bites with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS) can suppress entire populations of unusually efficient malaria vector species that predominantly feed indoors on humans. Mosquitoes which usually feed on animals are less reliant on human blood, so they are far less vulnerable to population suppression effects of such human-targeted insecticidal measures. Fortunately, the dozens of mosquito species which primarily feed on animals are also relatively inefficient vectors of malaria, so personal protection against mosquito bites may be sufficient to eliminate transmission. However, a handful of mosquito species are particularly problematic vectors of residual malaria transmission, because they feed readily on both humans and animals. These unusual vectors feed often enough on humans to be potent malaria vectors, but also often enough on animals to evade population control with LLINs, IRS or any other insecticidal personal protection measure targeted only to humans. Anopheles arabiensis and A. coluzzii in Africa, A. darlingi in South America and A. farauti in Oceania, as well as A. culicifacies species E, A. fluviatilis species S, A. lesteri and A. minimus in Asia, all feed readily on either humans or animals and collectively mediate residual malaria transmission across most of the tropics. Eliminating malaria transmission by vectors exhibiting such dual host preferences will require aggressive mosquito population abatement, rather than just personal protection of humans. Population suppression of even these particularly troublesome vectors is achievable with a variety of existing vector control technologies that remain underdeveloped or underexploited.},

To provide examples on how future health can be incorporated in existing scenarios, we linked the sociocultural, economic, and environmental developments described in three sets of scenarios (special report on emission scenarios (SRES), global environmental outlook-3 (GEO3), and world water scenarios (WWS)) to three potential, but imaginary, health futures (“age of emerging infectious diseases”, “age of medical technology”, and “age of sustained health”).

The advent of model-based geostatistics (MBG) has allowed these maps to be generated in a formal statistical framework, providing robust metrics of map uncertainty that enhances their utility for decision-makers. In many settings, decision-makers require spatially aggregated measures over large regions such as the mean prevalence within a country or administrative region, or national populations living under different levels of risk. Existing MBG mapping approaches provide suitable metrics of local uncertainty–the fidelity of predictions at each mapped pixel–but have not been adapted for measuring uncertainty over large areas, due largely to a series of fundamental computational constraints. Here the authors present a new efficient approximating algorithm that can generate for the first time the necessary joint simulation of prevalence values across the very large prediction spaces needed for global scale mapping. This new approach is implemented in conjunction with an established model for P. falciparum allowing robust estimates of mean prevalence at any specified level of spatial aggregation. The model is used to provide estimates of national populations at risk under three policy-relevant prevalence thresholds, along with accompanying model-based measures of uncertainty. By overcoming previously unchallenged computational barriers, this study illustrates how MBG approaches, already at the forefront of infectious disease mapping, can be extended to provide large-scale aggregate measures appropriate for decision-makers.},

	abstract = {In Tanzania malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in children under 5 years. The disease ranks number one in both outpatient and inpatient statistics. The socio-economic impact of malaria is so high that it contributes highly to poverty and underdevelopment. Efforts made during the past century to combat and control malaria have not been successful. The prospects of achieving the Abuja declaration targets are uncertain within the remaining period of time. Currently, the Ministry of Health through a 5-year strategic plan advocates four main approaches in the fight against the disease. These include improved case management, vector control using insecticide treated mosquito nets, prevention and control of malaria in pregnancy and epidemic preparedness, prevention and control. However, these strategies face various challenges including inadequate human, financial, and material resources; inefficiency in the healthcare system that is incapable of providing quality health services and access to prompt diagnosis and treatment; lack of an effective disease surveillance system; and an inefficient health education communication mechanism. Tanzania is at the crossroads and is challenged with the need to introduce a new antimalarial treatment regimen and the reintroduction of DDT for indoor residual spray. Unless malaria control strategy adopts an integrated approach its success is far from being realized. This article reviews the current malaria control strategies and its challenges in Tanzania and proposes new strategies.},

However, the relation among physical access, travel behavior, and the uptake of healthcare is difficult to quantify. METHODS:Using anonymized mobile phone data from 2008 to 2009, we analyze individual and spatially aggregated travel patterns of 14,816,521 subscribers across Kenya and compare these measures to (1) estimated travel times to health facilities and (2) data on the uptake of 2 preventive healthcare interventions in an area of western Kenya: childhood immunizations and antenatal care. RESULTS:We document that long travel times to health facilities are strongly correlated with increased mobility in geographically isolated areas. Furthermore, we found that in areas with equal physical access to healthcare, mobile phone-derived measures of mobility predict which regions are lacking preventive care. CONCLUSIONS:Routinely collected mobile phone data provide a simple and low-cost approach to mapping the uptake of preventive healthcare in low-income settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Accurate information on the geographical distribution of malaria is important for efficient resource allocation. The Lao People's Democratic Republic has experienced a major decline in malaria morbidity and mortality in the past decade. However, efforts to respond effectively to these changes have been impeded by lack of detailed data on malaria distribution. In 2008, a countrywide survey on Plasmodium falciparum diagnosed in health centres and villages was initiated to develop a detailed P. falciparum risk map with the aim to identify priority areas for malaria control, estimate population at risk, and guide resource allocation in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. METHODS:P. falciparum incidence data were collected from point-referenced villages and health centres for the period 2006-2008 during a country-wide survey between December 2008 and January 2009. Using the highest recorded annual rate, continuous surfaces of P. falciparum incidence were produced by the inverse distance weighted interpolation technique. RESULTS:Incidence rates were obtained from 3,876 villages and 685 health centres. The risk map shows that P. falciparum is highly heterogeneous in the northern and central regions of the country with large areas of no transmission. In the southern part, transmission is pervasive and the risk of P. falciparum is high. It was estimated that 3.4 million people (60\% of the population) live at risk of malaria. CONCLUSIONS:This paper presents the first comprehensive malaria risk map of the Lao People's Democratic Republic based entirely on empirical data. The estimated population at risk is substantially lower than previous estimates, reflecting the presence of vast areas with focal or no malaria transmission as identified in this study. These findings provide important guidance for malaria control interventions in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and underline the need for detailed data on malaria to accurately predict risk in countries with heterogeneous transmission.},

	abstract = {There is a consensus that malaria is a growing problem in African highlands. This is surprising because many parts of the highlands were considered too cold to support transmission. In this report, we examined how transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in six villages changed along an altitude transect in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, from 300 m to 1700 m. Routine entomological collections were made using spray catches and light traps for 15 mo. Direct estimates of entomological inoculation rates and indirect estimates of vectorial capacity suggested a {\textgreater}1000-fold reduction in transmission intensity between the holoendemic lowland and the hypoendemic highland plateau. Lowland transmission was perennial with a significant peak in the cool season after the long rains in May, when vectors densities were high. In the highlands, low temperatures prevented parasite development in mosquitoes during the cool season rains, and highland transmission was therefore limited to the warm dry season when vector densities were low. The primary effect of increasing altitude was a log-linear reduction in vector abundance and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in the proportion of infective mosquitoes. Highland malaria transmission was maintained at extraordinarily low vector densities. We discuss herein the implications of these findings for modeling malaria and suggest that process-based models of malaria transmission risk should be improved by considering the direct effect of temperature on vector densities. Our findings suggest that variation in the short rains in November and changes in agricultural practices are likely to be important generators of epidemics in the Usambaras.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Emerging antimalarial drug resistance in mobile populations remains a significant public health concern. We compared two regimens of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in military and civilians on the Thai-Cambodian border to evaluate national treatment policy. METHODS:Efficacy and safety of two and three-day regimens of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were compared as a nested open-label evaluation within a malaria cohort study in 222 otherwise healthy volunteers (18\% malaria-infected at baseline). The first 80 volunteers with slide-confirmed Plasmodium falciparum or vivax malaria were randomized 1:1 to receive either regimen (total dose 360 mg dihydroartemisinin and 2880 mg piperaquine) and followed weekly for up to 6 months. The primary endpoint was malaria recurrence by day 42. Volunteers with vivax infection received primaquine at study discharge with six months follow-up. RESULTS:Eighty patients (60 vivax, 15 falciparum, and 5 mixed) were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Intention-to-treat all-species efficacy at Day 42 was 85\% for the two-day regimen (95\% CI 69-94) and 90\% for the three-day regimen (95\% CI 75-97). PCR-adjusted falciparum efficacy was 75\% in both groups with nearly half (45\%) still parasitemic at Day 3. Plasma piperaquine levels were comparable to prior published reports, but on the day of recrudescence were below measurable in vitro piperaquine IC50 levels in all falciparum treatment failures. CONCLUSIONS:In the brief period since introduction of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, there is early evidence suggesting declining efficacy relative to previous reports. Parasite IC50 levels in excess of plasma piperaquine levels seen only in treatment failures raises concern for clinically significant piperaquine resistance in Cambodia. These findings warrant improved monitoring of clinical outcomes and follow-up, given few available alternative drugs. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01280162.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The RTS,S malaria vaccine may soon be licensed. Models of impact of such vaccines have mainly considered deployment via the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in areas of stable endemic transmission of Plasmodium falciparum, and have been calibrated for such settings. Their applicability to low transmission settings is unclear. Evaluations of the efficiency of different deployment strategies in diverse settings should consider uncertainties in model structure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An ensemble of 14 individual-based stochastic simulation models of P. falciparum dynamics, with differing assumptions about immune decay, transmission heterogeneity, and treatment access, was constructed. After fitting to an extensive library of field data, each model was used to predict the likely health benefits of RTS,S deployment, via EPI (with or without catch-up vaccinations), supplementary vaccination of school-age children, or mass vaccination every 5 y. Settings with seasonally varying transmission, with overall pre-intervention entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) of two, 11, and 20 infectious bites per person per annum, were considered. Predicted benefits of EPI vaccination programs over the simulated 14-y time horizon were dependent on duration of protection. Nevertheless, EPI strategies (with an initial catch-up phase) averted the most deaths per dose at the higher EIRs, although model uncertainty increased with EIR. At two infectious bites per person per annum, mass vaccination strategies substantially reduced transmission, leading to much greater health effects per dose, even at modest coverage. CONCLUSIONS: In higher transmission settings, EPI strategies will be most efficient, but vaccination additional to the EPI in targeted low transmission settings, even at modest coverage, might be more efficient than national-level vaccination of infants. The feasibility and economics of mass vaccination, and the circumstances under which vaccination will avert epidemics, remain unclear. The approach of using an ensemble of models provides more secure conclusions than a single-model approach, and suggests greater confidence in predictions of health effects for lower transmission settings than for higher ones.},

Infections by P. malariae and P. ovale were both observed in individuals of all age groups and their cumulative prevalences reached 50.5\% and 40.3\%, respectively. Malaria was responsible for 162 (60.9\%) of 266 febrile episodes; 159 of these attacks were due to P. falciparum, three to P. ovale, and none to P. malariae. The incidence of malaria attacks was 40 times higher in children 0-4 years of age than in adults more than 40 years old. Our findings suggest that sterile immunity and clinical protection are never fully achieved in humans continuously exposed since birth to intense transmission.},

Mosquito responses to terrain features and various meteorological factors are briefly summarized with the object of improving our understanding of the samples provided by several classes of sampling techniques. The two major environmental influences upon the composition of a sample are the terrain features and several meteorological factors. As each sampling site is unique, a sample provides little direct information of the numbers of mosquitoes within the much broader area it is supposed to represent but it can reflect population changes at the site. However, the population changes usually are masked by meteorological effects upon flight activity. Data from Florida field studies were utilized to adjust trap catches to compensate for meteorological conditions during the catch period to provide more standard samples.},

	abstract = {During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography.},

Open source models for outputs of scientific research funded by tax-payers and charities are becoming the norm. This has yet to be extended to malaria epidemiology and control. METHODS:The exhaustive searches and assembly process for a global database of malaria parasite prevalence as part of the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) are described. The different data sources visited and how productive these were in terms of availability of parasite rate (PR) data are presented, followed by a description of the methods used to assemble a relational database and an associated geographic information system. The challenges facing spatial data assembly from varied sources are described in an effort to help inform similar future applications. RESULTS:At the time of writing, the MAP database held 3,351 spatially independent PR estimates from community surveys conducted since 1985. These include 3,036 Plasmodium falciparum and 1,347 Plasmodium vivax estimates in 74 countries derived from 671 primary sources. More than half of these data represent malaria prevalence after the year 2000. CONCLUSION:This database will help refine maps of the global spatial limits of malaria and be the foundation for the development of global malaria endemicity models as part of MAP. A widespread application of these maps is envisaged. The data compiled and the products generated by MAP are planned to be released in June 2009 to facilitate a more informed approach to global malaria control.},

	abstract = {Health care utilization is affected by several factors including geographic accessibility. Empirical data on utilization of health facilities is important to understanding geographic accessibility and defining health facility catchments at a national level. Accurately defining catchment population improves the analysis of gaps in access, commodity needs and interpretation of disease incidence. Here, empirical household survey data on treatment seeking for fever were used to model the utilisation of public health facilities and define their catchment areas and populations in northern Namibia. This study uses data from the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) of 2009 on treatment seeking for fever among children under the age of five years to characterize facility utilisation. Probability of attendance of public health facilities for fever treatment was modelled against a theoretical surface of travel times using a three parameter logistic model. The fitted model was then applied to a population surface to predict the number of children likely to use a public health facility during an episode of fever in northern Namibia. Overall, from the MIS survey, the prevalence of fever among children was 17.6\% CI [16.0-19.1] (401 of 2,283 children) while public health facility attendance for fever was 51.1\%, [95\%CI: 46.2-56.0]. The coefficients of the logistic model of travel time against fever treatment at public health facilities were all significant (p {\textless} 0.001). From this model, probability of facility attendance remained relatively high up to 180 minutes (3 hours) and thereafter decreased steadily. Total public health facility catchment population of children under the age five was estimated to be 162,286 in northern Namibia with an estimated fever burden of 24,830 children. Of the estimated fevers, 8,021 (32.3\%) were within 30 minutes of travel time to the nearest health facility while 14,902 (60.0\%) were within 1 hour. This study demonstrates the potential of routine household surveys to empirically model health care utilisation for the treatment of childhood fever and define catchment populations enhancing the possibilities of accurate commodity needs assessment and calculation of disease incidence. These methods could be extended to other African countries where detailed mapping of health facilities exists.},

	abstract = {Most malaria risk reduction strategies are firmly embedded in biomedical practices and public health perspectives. National and international programmes to 'control' malaria are particularly characterised by the promotion of public health interventions which converge on the disease vector, the malaria mosquito, notably through the use of indoor household spraying with insecticides, and the deployment of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs). With convincing evidence for the effectiveness of ITNs in reducing the incidence of malaria, control programmes have emphasised the notion of 'scaling-up' bednet coverage. Much previous research on people's 'compliance' with bednet programmes has tended to focus on the quantification of bednet usage and on deriving explanations for 'non-compliance' based on household or individual indicators such as wealth, age, gender or educational level, or on climatic factors such as season and temperature. However, malaria risk behaviours are also rooted in wider aspects of local livelihoods, and socio-cultural beliefs and practices which interplay with the use and, crucially, non-use, of bednets. This paper draws on empirical data derived from in-depth, one-to-one semi-structured interviews, focus groups and participatory methods (mapping and diagramming) with participants in two villages in rural Tanzania to explore the nature of these practices and vulnerabilities, and their potential impact on malaria exposure risk. Participants included farmers and pastoralists, both men and women, as well as village 'officials'. By eliciting local understandings of malaria-related behaviours we explore how malaria risks are played out in people's everyday lives, and the circumstances and decision-making which underpin non-usage of bednets. Our findings reveal the importance of shifting sleeping patterns in response to livelihood needs and socio-cultural practices and events. These arrangements militate against the consistent and sustained use of the bednet which are called for by public health policies. In particular we demonstrate the importance of the spatial and temporal dimensions of farming practices and the role of conflict over access to shared land; the impact of livelihood activities on malaria risks for school-aged children; risk behaviours during 'special' socio-cultural events such as funeral ceremonies; and routine, outdoor activities around dawn and dusk and the gendered nature of these practices.},

	abstract = {Brazil has experienced an unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), with {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde30,000 cases reported to date. ZIKV was first detected in Brazil in May 2015, and cases of microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection were identified in November 2015. We performed next-generation sequencing to generate seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes sampled from four self-limited cases, one blood donor, one fatal adult case, and one newborn with microcephaly and congenital malformations. Results of phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a single introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, which we estimated to have occurred between May and December 2013, more than 12 months before the detection of ZIKV in Brazil. The estimated date of origin coincides with an increase in air passengers to Brazil from ZIKV-endemic areas, as well as with reported outbreaks in the Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are phylogenetically interspersed with those from other South American and Caribbean countries. Mapping mutations onto existing structural models revealed the context of viral amino acid changes present in the outbreak lineage; however, no shared amino acid changes were found among the three currently available virus genomes from microcephaly cases. Municipality-level incidence data indicate that reports of suspected microcephaly in Brazil best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 17 of pregnancy, although this correlation does not demonstrate causation. Our genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of this emerging virus in the Americas.},

	abstract = {Reduction of deaths associated with malaria in children is a primary goal of malaria control programmes in Africa, but there has been little discussion about how changes in mortality will be measured. This paper assesses recent historical changes in the contribution of malaria to child survival in Africa by examining data from demographic surveillance systems (DSS) in 25 mainly rural settings. The data were adjusted for the varying sensitivity and specificity of verbal autopsies (VA) in different ranges of malaria mortality and for varying parasite prevalences. Average malaria mortality in the DSS sites in west Africa was 7.8 per 1000 child-years between 1982 and 1998; the rate did not change significantly over this period. In the sites in east and southern Africa combined, malaria mortality was 6.5 per 1000 child-years between 1982 and 1989, but it increased to 11.9 per 1000 child-years between 1990 and 1998. All-cause child mortality and non-malaria mortality, by contrast, decreased significantly over time in both regions; consequently, the proportion of deaths due to malaria rose from 18\% to 23\% in west African sites and from 18\% to 37\% in east and southern African sites between 1982-89 and 1990-98. If malaria mortality fell at a rate consistent with the Roll Back Malaria target of halving malaria mortality by the year 2010, an individual DSS of a total population of 63 500 could with adequate VA adjustment detect this reduction after 7 years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing coverage of malaria vector control interventions globally has led to significant reductions in disease burden. However due to its high recurrent cost, there is a need to determine if and when vector control can be safely scaled back after transmission has been reduced. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A mathematical model of Plasmodium falciparum malaria epidemiology was simulated to determine the impact of scaling back vector control on transmission and disease. A regression analysis of simulation results was conducted to derive predicted probabilities of resurgence, severity of resurgence and time to resurgence under various settings. Results indicate that, in the absence of secular changes in transmission, there are few scenarios where vector control can be removed without high expectation of resurgence. These, potentially safe, scenarios are characterized by low historic entomological inoculation rates, successful vector control programmes that achieve elimination or near elimination, and effective surveillance systems with high coverage and effective treatment of malaria cases. CONCLUSIONS: Programmes and funding agencies considering scaling back or withdrawing vector control from previously malaria endemic areas need to first carefully consider current receptivity and other available interventions in a risk assessment. Surveillance for resurgence needs to be continuously conducted over a long period of time in order to ensure a rapid response should vector control be withdrawn.},

Insecticidal nets reduce the mosquito-human contact rate and simultaneously decrease mosquito populations. However, LLINs demonstrate dissimilar efficiency against different species of malaria mosquitoes. Various factors have been proposed as an explanation, including differences in insecticide-induced mortality, flight characteristics, or persistence of attack. Here we present a discrete agent-based approach that enables the efficiency of LLINs, baited traps and Insecticide Residual Sprays (IRS) to be examined. The model is calibrated with hut-level experimental data to compare the efficiency of protection against two mosquito species: Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis. We show that while such data does not allow an unambiguous identification of the details of how LLINs alter the vector behavior, the model calibrations quantify the overall impact of LLINs for the two different mosquito species. The simulations are generalized to community-scale scenarios that systematically demonstrate the lower efficiency of the LLINs in control of An. arabiensis compared to An. gambiae.},

METHODS:We obtained high-resolution spatial and epidemiological data on health services, population, transport network, topography, land cover and paediatric fever treatment in four Kenyan districts to develop access and use models for government health services in Kenya. Community survey data were used to model use of government health services by febrile children. A model based on the transport network was then implemented and adjusted for actual use patterns. We compared the predictive accuracy of this refined model to that of Euclidean distance metrics. RESULTS Higher-order facilities were more attractive to patients (54\%, 58\% and 60\% in three scenarios) than lower-order ones. The transport network model, adjusted for competition between facilities, was most accurate and selected as the best-fit model. It estimated that 63\% of the population of the study districts were within the 1 h national access benchmark, against 82\% estimated by the Euclidean model. CONCLUSIONS:Extrapolating the results from the best-fit model in study districts to the national level shows that approximately six million people are currently incorrectly estimated to have access to government health services within 1 h.

	abstract = {The aim of this review was to compare the effects of different dengue vector control interventions (i.e. biological control, chemical control, environmental management and integrated vector management) with respect to the following entomological parameters: Breteau index (BI), container index (CI), and house index (HI). We systematically searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, the Dengue Bulletin of the World Health Organization and reference lists of retrieved articles on dengue vector control interventions in developing countries. We extracted data on the effectiveness of different dengue vector control interventions (defined as the relative reduction of an entomological measure caused by the intervention compared with the control or pre-intervention phase) and calculated a measure of combined relative effectiveness, with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% c.i.). We identified 56 publications covering 61 dengue vector control interventions. Integrated vector management was found to be the most effective method to reduce the CI, HI and BI, resulting in random combined relative effectiveness values of 0.12 (95\% c.i. 0.02-0.62), 0.17 (95\% c.i. 0.02-1.28) and 0.33 (95\% c.i. 0.22-0.48), respectively. Environmental management showed a relatively low effectiveness of 0.71 (95\% c.i. 0.55-0.90) for the BI, 0.49 (95\% c.i. 0.30-0.79) for the CI and 0.43 (95\% c.i. 0.31-0.59) for the HI. Biological control (relative effectiveness for the CI: 0.18) usually targeted a small number of people (median population size: 200; range 20-2500), whereas integrated vector management focused on larger populations (median: 12 450; range: 210-9 600 000). In conclusion, dengue vector control is effective in reducing vector populations, particularly when interventions use a community-based, integrated approach, which is tailored to local eco-epidemiological and sociocultural settings and combined with educational programmes to increase knowledge and understanding of best practice. New research should assess the density-dependent effectiveness of each control measure in order to estimate whether reducing vector numbers has an impact on dengue transmission when populations are at a critical threshold.},

	doi = {10.1186/1478-7954-8-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Coverage and quality of cause-of-death (CoD) data varies across countries and time. Valid, reliable, and comparable assessments of trends in causes of death from even the best systems are limited by three problems: a) changes in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) over time; b) the use of tabulation lists where substantial detail on causes of death is lost; and c) many deaths assigned to causes that cannot or should not be considered underlying causes of death, often called garbage codes (GCs). The Global Burden of Disease Study and the World Health Organization have developed various methods to enhance comparability of CoD data. In this study, we attempt to build on these approaches to enhance the utility of national cause-of-death data for public health analysis. METHODS:Based on careful consideration of 4,434 country-years of CoD data from 145 countries from 1901 to 2008, encompassing 743 million deaths in ICD versions 1 to 10 as well as country-specific cause lists, we have developed a public health-oriented cause-of-death list. These 56 causes are organized hierarchically and encompass all deaths. Each cause has been mapped from ICD-6 to ICD-10 and, where possible, they have also been mapped to the International List of Causes of Death 1-5. We developed a typology of different classes of GCs. In each ICD revision, GCs have been identified. Target causes to which these GCs should be redistributed have been identified based on certification practice and/or pathophysiology. Proportionate redistribution, statistical models, and expert algorithms have been developed to redistribute GCs to target codes for each age-sex group. RESULTS:The fraction of all deaths assigned to GCs varies tremendously across countries and revisions of the ICD. In general, across all country-years of data available, GCs have declined from more than 43\% in ICD-7 to 24\% in ICD-10. In some regions, such as Australasia, GCs in 2005 are as low as 11\%, while in some developing countries, such as Thailand, they are greater than 50\%. Across different age groups, the composition of GCs varies tremendously - three classes of GCs steadily increase with age, but ambiguous codes within a particular disease chapter are also common for injuries at younger ages. The impact of redistribution is to change the number of deaths assigned to particular causes for a given age-sex group. These changes alter ranks across countries for any given year by a number of different causes, change time trends, and alter the rank order of causes within a country. CONCLUSIONS:By mapping CoD through different ICD versions and redistributing GCs, we believe the public health utility of CoD data can be substantially enhanced, leading to an increased demand for higher quality CoD data from health sector decision-makers.},

	abstract = {Different malarial situations in Africa within the past 40 years are discussed in order to evaluate the impact of climatic and human factors on the disease. North of the equator, more droughts and lower rainfall have been recorded since 1972; and in eastern and southern Africa, there have been alternating dry and wet periods in relation to El Niño. Since 1955, the increase in human population from 125 to 450 million has resulted in both expansion of land cultivation and urbanization. In stable malaria areas of West and Central Africa and on the Madagascar coasts, the endemic situation has not changed since 1955. However, in unstable malaria areas such as the highlands and Sahel significant changes have occurred. In Madagascar, cessation of malaria control programs resulted in the deadly epidemic of 1987-88. The same situation was observed in Swaziland in 1984-85. In Uganda, malaria incidence has increased more than 30 times in the highlands (1,500-1,800 m), but its altitudinal limit has not overcome that of the beginning of the century. Cultivation of valley bottoms and extension of settlements are in large part responsible for this increase, along with abnormally heavy rainfall that favored the severe epidemic of 1994. A similar increase in malaria was observed in neighboring highlands of Rwanda and Burundi, and epidemics have been recorded in Ethiopia since 1958. In contrast, in the Sahel (Niayes region, Senegal), stricken by droughts since 1972, endemic malaria decreased drastically after the disappearance of the main vector, Anopheles funestus, due to the destruction of its larval sites by cultivation. Even during the very wet year of 1995. An funestus did not reinvade the region and malaria did not increase. The same situation was observed in the Sahelian zone of Niger. Therefore, the temperature increase of 0.5 degree C during the last 2 decades cannot be incriminated as a major cause for these malaria changes, which are mainly due to the combination of climatic, human, and operational factors.},

As part of WHO's Roll Back Malaria initiative, African heads of state pledged that by 2005, 60\% of pregnant women will receive malaria chemoprophylaxis or intermittent preventive treatment (IPT). We performed a cluster sample survey to study the use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for IPT among recently pregnant women in February 2000 in Blantyre District, Malawi. Among 391 women in the sample, 98.6\% had attended antenatal clinic at least once and 90.2\% knew that SP/IPT was recommended during pregnancy. Overall, only 36.8\% received the full recommended two-dose regimen of SP/IPT. Using data from 187 women with antenatal clinic cards, we found that residence location, housing type and gender/age/education of the head of household were not associated with failure to receive SP/IPT. Adjusting for education, multigravid women were more likely not to receive the recommended SP/IPT regimen (RR 1.2, 95\% CI 1.02-1.5, P=0.03). A substantial effort to improve the delivery and use of SP/IPT in Malawi will be necessary, but the Roll Back Malaria 2005 goal appears achievable.},

	abstract = {Places do well when they promote transformations along the dimensions of economic geography: higher densities as cities grow; shorter distances as workers and businesses migrate closer to density; and fewer divisions as nations lower their economic borders and enter world markets to take advantage of scale and trade in specialized products. World Development Report 2009 concludes that the transformations along these three dimensions-density, distance, and division-are essential for development and should be encouraged. The conclusion is controversial. Slum-dwellers now number a billion, but the rush to cities continues. A billion people live in lagging areas of developing nations, remote from globalization's many benefi ts. And poverty and high mortality persist among the world's “bottom billion,” trapped without access to global markets, even as others grow more prosperous and live ever longer lives. Concern for these three intersecting billions often comes with the prescription that growth must be spatially balanced. This report has a different message: economic growth will be unbalanced. To try to spread it out is to discourage it-to fi ght prosperity, not poverty. But development can still be inclusive, even for people who start their lives distant from dense economic activity. For growth to be rapid and shared, governments must promote economic integration, the pivotal concept, as this report argues, in the policy debates on urbanization, territorial development, and regional integration. Instead, all three debates overemphasize place-based interventions. Reshaping Economic Geography reframes these debates to include all the instruments of integration-spatially blind institutions, spatially connective infrastructure, and spatially targeted interventions. By calibrating the blend of these instruments, today's developers can reshape their economic geography. If they do this well, their growth will still be unbalanced, but their development will be inclusive.},

Most residents had detectable antibodies within one week after an attack, which began to wane after a month. The strongest reactions were obtained in cases of falciparum malaria with the homologous antigen and in cases of vivax malaria with P fieldi. The overall pattern of results was the same in the immigrants but the proportions positive for malaria antibodies, mean titres, persistence of antibodies, and the cross-reaction were usually greater.

The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) varied from 0 to 166 infective bites per person per rainy season. Detailed field surveys identified the major Anopheles gambiae s.l. breeding habitats.

These data requirements are generally addressed with some form of national Health Management Information System (HMIS) which coordinates the routine collection and compilation of data from national health facilities. HMIS in most developing countries are characterised by widespread under-reporting. Here we present a method to adjust incomplete data to allow prediction of national outpatient treatment burdens. We demonstrate this method with the example of outpatient treatments for malaria within the Kenyan HMIS. Three alternative modelling frameworks were developed and tested in which space-time geostatistical prediction algorithms were used to predict the monthly tally of treatments for presumed malaria cases (MC) at facilities where such records were missing. Models were compared by a cross-validation exercise and the model found to most accurately predict MC incorporated available data on the total number of patients visiting each facility each month. A space-time stochastic simulation framework to accompany this model was developed and tested in order to provide estimates of both local and regional prediction uncertainty. The level of accuracy provided by the predictive model, and the accompanying estimates of uncertainty around the predictions, demonstrate how this tool can mitigate the uncertainties caused by missing data, substantially enhancing the utility of existing HMIS data to health-service decision-makers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of Plasmodium species infections are asymptomatic with densities too low to be detectable with standard diagnostic techniques. The importance of such asymptomatic plasmodium infections in malaria transmission is probably related to their duration and density. To explore the duration of asymptomatic plasmodium infections and changes in parasite densities over time, a cohort of participants who were infected with Plasmodium parasites was observed over a 2-year follow-up period. METHODS: In this open cohort study, inhabitants of four villages in Vietnam were invited to participate in baseline and subsequent 3-monthly surveys up to 24 months, which included the collection of venous blood samples. Samples were batch-screened using ultra-sensitive (u)PCR (lower limit of detection of 22 parasites per mL). Participants found to be infected by uPCR during any of these surveys were invited to join a prospective cohort and provide monthly blood samples. We estimated the persistence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections and changes in parasite densities over a study period of 24 months. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2013, and Jan 8, 2016, 356 villagers participated in between one and 22 surveys. These study participants underwent 4248 uPCR evaluations (11·9 tests per participant). 1874 (32\%) of 4248 uPCR tests indicated a plasmodium infection; 679 (36\%) of 1874 tests were P falciparum monoinfections, 507 (27\%) were P vivax monoinfections, 463 (25\%) were co-infections with P falciparum and P vivax, and 225 (12\%) were indeterminate species of Plasmodium. The median duration of P falciparum infection was 2 months (IQR 1-3); after accounting for censoring, participants had a 20\% chance of having parasitaemia for 4 months or longer. The median duration of P vivax infection was 6 months (3-9), and participants had a 59\% chance of having parasitaemia for 4 months or longer. The parasite densities of persistent infections oscillated; following ultralow-density infections, high-density infections developed frequently. INTERPRETATION: Persistent largely asymptomatic P vivax and P falciparum infections are common in this area of low seasonal malaria transmission. Infections with low-density parasitaemias can develop into much higher density infections at a later time, which are likely to sustain malaria endemicity.

A variety of measures directed against the aquatic stages of the anopheline vectors provided the main strategy for the antimalarial programs in Palestine/Israel, Italy, and the Tennessee River Valley of the United States. Source reduction-the modification or elimination of aquatic habitats to reduce mosquito breeding-was applied extensively and proved decisive. In all three regions, transmission of malaria was reduced to the point of extinction. Effective measures against anopheline larvae, in particular through source reduction, depend upon locally derived ecologic concepts that can be adapted to each vector species and applied continuously without limit of time.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The opportunity to integrate vector management across multiple vector-borne diseases is particularly plausible for malaria and lymphatic filariasis (LF) control where both diseases are transmitted by the same vector. To date most examples of integrated control targeting these diseases have been unanticipated consequences of malaria vector control, rather than planned strategies that aim to maximize the efficacy and take the complex ecological and biological interactions between the two diseases into account. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a general model of malaria and LF transmission and derived expressions for the basic reproductive number (R0) for each disease. Transmission of both diseases was most sensitive to vector mortality and biting rate. Simulating different levels of coverage of long lasting-insecticidal nets (LLINs) and larval control confirms the effectiveness of these interventions for the control of both diseases. When LF was maintained near the critical density of mosquitoes, minor levels of vector control (8\% coverage of LLINs or treatment of 20\% of larval sites) were sufficient to eliminate the disease. Malaria had a far greater R0 and required a 90\% population coverage of LLINs in order to eliminate it. When the mosquito density was doubled, 36\% and 58\% coverage of LLINs and larval control, respectively, were required for LF elimination; and malaria elimination was possible with a combined coverage of 78\% of LLINs and larval control. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the low level of vector control required to eliminate LF, simulations suggest that prevalence of LF will decrease at a slower rate than malaria, even at high levels of coverage. If representative of field situations, integrated management should take into account not only how malaria control can facilitate filariasis elimination, but strike a balance between the high levels of coverage of (multiple) interventions required for malaria with the long duration predicted to be required for filariasis elimination.},

These observations have led to speculations concerning the distribution of disease, the acquisition of protection, and vaccination prospects. Speculations on the latter have varied from pessimism about the possibility of developing a vaccine that would protect most people against most parasites, to optimism based on the hypothesis that a local P. falciparum population is composed of a few discrete subpopulations. If this hypothesis is correct, it may be possible to prevent most severe disease with a narrow-spectrum vaccination against a virulent minority of the subpopulations, or transmission could be interrupted by a relatively low coverage of a broad-spectrum vaccination. A conceptual model that might accommodate the observations is outlined. Its plausibility and testability are considered, as well as some of its implications for the planning and interpretation of epidemiological surveys and intervention trials, and perhaps for selection of antigens for inclusion in vaccines.},

We develop and analyze a new mathematical model to describe the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the contact rate between mosquito vectors and hosts. The model includes odor plumes generated by spatially distributed hosts, wind velocity, and mosquito behavior based on both the prevailing wind and the odor plume. On a spatial scale of meters and a time scale of minutes, we compare the effectiveness of different plume-finding and plume-tracking strategies that mosquitoes could use to locate a host. The results show that two different models of chemotaxis are capable of producing comparable results given appropriate parameter choices and that host finding is optimized by a strategy of flying across the wind until the odor plume is intercepted. We also assess the impact of changing the level of host aggregation on mosquito host-finding success near the end of the host-seeking flight. When clusters of hosts are more tightly associated on smaller patches, the odor plume is narrower and the biting rate per host is decreased. For two host groups of unequal number but equal spatial density, the biting rate per host is lower in the group with more individuals, indicative of an attack abatement effect of host aggregation. We discuss how this approach could assist parameter choices in compartmental models that do not explicitly model the spatial arrangement of individuals and how the model could address larger spatial scales and other probability models for mosquito behavior, such as Lévy distributions.},

Disruption of Pfs47 greatly reduced parasite survival in the mosquito, and this phenotype could be reverted by genetic complementation of the parasite or by disruption of the mosquito complement-like system. Pfs47 suppresses midgut nitration responses that are critical to activate the complement-like system.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Malaria is spread by mosquitoes that are increasingly recognised to have diverse biting behaviours. How a mosquito in a specific environment responds to differing availability of blood-host species is largely unknown and yet critical to vector control efficacy. A parsimonious mathematical model is proposed that accounts for a diverse range of host-biting behaviours and assesses their impact on combining long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) with a novel approach to malaria control: livestock treated with insecticidal compounds ('endectocides') that kill biting mosquitoes. RESULTS:Simulations of a malaria control programme showed marked differences across biting ecologies in the efficacy of both LLINs as a stand-alone tool and the combination of LLINs with endectocide-treated cattle. During the intervals between LLIN mass campaigns, concordant use of endectocides is projected to reduce the bounce-back in malaria prevalence that can occur as LLIN efficacy decays over time, especially if replacement campaigns are delayed. Integrating these approaches can also dramatically improve the attainability of local elimination; endectocidal treatment schedules required to achieve this aim are provided for malaria vectors with different biting ecologies. CONCLUSIONS:Targeting blood-feeding mosquitoes by treating livestock with endectocides offers a potentially useful complement to existing malaria control programmes centred on LLIN distribution. This approach is likely to be effective against vectors with a wide range of host-preferences and biting behaviours, with the exception of species that are so strictly anthropophilic that most blood meals are taken on humans even when humans are much less available than non-human hosts. Identifying this functional relationship in wild mosquito populations and ascertaining the extent to which it differs, within as well as between species, is a critical next step before targets can be set for employing this novel approach and combination.},

A mathematical model is developed to assess the epidemiological implications of current vector control tools, bednets and indoor residual spray, preferentially suppressing the more typical indoor biting mosquitoes. It is demonstrated that even if the GOUNDRY mosquitoes have a decreased preference for human blood, vector controls which select for increased GOUNDRY abundance relative to their indoor biting counterparts risks intensifying malaria transmission. Given the widely observed phenomenon of outdoor biting by major malaria vectors, this behaviour should not be ignored in future modelling efforts and warrants serious consideration in control programme strategy.},

	abstract = {Individual animal movement has been a focus of intense research and considerable controversy over the last two decades, however the understanding of wider ecological implications of various movement behaviours is lacking. In this paper, we consider this issue in the context of pattern formation. Using an individual-based modelling approach and computer simulations, we first show that density dependence (“auto-taxis”) of the individual movement in a population of random walkers typically results in the formation of a strongly heterogeneous population distribution consisting of clearly defined animal clusters or patches. We then show that, when the movement takes place in a large spatial domain, the properties of the clusters are significantly different in the populations of Brownian and non-Brownian walkers. Whilst clusters tend to be stable in the case of Brownian motion, in the population of Levy walkers clusters are dynamical so that the number of clusters fluctuates in the course of time. We also show that the population dynamics of non-Brownian walkers exhibits two different time scales: a short time scale of the relaxation of the initial condition and a long time scale when one type of dynamics is replaced by another. Finally, we show that the distribution of sample values in the populations of Brownian and non-Brownian walkers is significantly different.},

We determined Aedes aegypti flight range and dispersal patterns from 21 mark-release-recapture experiments conducted over 11 years (1991-2002) in Puerto Rico and Thailand. Dispersal was compared by release location, sex, age, season, and village. For all experiments, the majority of mosquitoes were collected from their release house or adjacent house. Inter-village movement was detected rarely, with a few mosquitoes moving a maximum of 512 meters from one Thai village to the next. Average dispersal distances were similar for males and females and females released indoors versus outdoors. The movement of Ae. aegypti was not influenced by season or age, but differed by village. Results demonstrate that adult Ae. aegypti disperse relatively short distances, suggesting that people rather than mosquitoes are the primary mode of dengue virus dissemination within and among communities.},

	abstract = {Summary Background Sustaining achievements in malaria control and making progress toward malaria elimination requires coordinated funding. We estimated domestic malaria spending by source in 106 countries that were malaria-endemic in 2000–16 or became malaria-free after 2000. Methods We collected 36 038 datapoints reporting government, out-of-pocket (OOP), and prepaid private malaria spending, as well as malaria treatment-seeking, costs of patient care, and drug prices. We estimated government spending on patient care for malaria, which was added to government spending by national malaria control programmes. For OOP malaria spending, we used data reported in National Health Accounts and estimated OOP spending on treatment. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to ensure estimates were complete and comparable across time and to generate uncertainty. Findings In 2016, US\$4·3 billion (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 4·2–4·4) was spent on malaria worldwide, an 8·5\% (95\% UI 8·1–8·9) per year increase over spending in 2000. Since 2000, OOP spending increased 3·8\% (3·3–4·2) per year, amounting to \$556 million (487–634) or 13·0\% (11·6–14·5) of all malaria spending in 2016. Governments spent \$1·2 billion (1·1–1·3) or 28·2\% (27·1–29·3) of all malaria spending in 2016, increasing 4·0\% annually since 2000. The source of malaria spending varied depending on whether countries were in the malaria control or elimination stage. Interpretation Tracking global malaria spending provides insight into how far the world is from reaching the malaria funding target of \$6·6 billion annually by 2020. Because most countries with a high burden of malaria are low income or lower-middle income, mobilising additional government resources for malaria might be challenging.

Few, however, have been created with the support of a comprehensive and extensive evidence-based approach. METHODS: Here we describe the generation of a global map of the dominant vector species (DVS) of malaria that makes use of predicted distribution maps for individual species or species complexes. RESULTS: Our global map highlights the spatial variability in the complexity of the vector situation. In Africa, An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and An. funestus are co-dominant across much of the continent, whereas in the Asian-Pacific region there is a highly complex situation with multi-species coexistence and variable species dominance. CONCLUSIONS: The competence of the mapping methodology to accurately portray DVS distributions is discussed. The comprehensive and contemporary database of species-specific spatial occurrence (currently available on request) will be made directly available via the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) website from early 2012.},

A single dose of primaquine, which is inexpensive and effective against mature gametocytes, could be added to further reduce the potential for posttreatment parasite transmission. Currently, we have few data regarding the effectiveness or safety of doing so. We collected data from 21 therapeutic efficacy trials of the National Antimalarial Drug Resistance Monitoring System of India conducted during 2009 to 2010, wherein 9 sites used single-dose primaquine (0.75 mg/kg of body weight) administered on day 2 along with artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) while 12 did not. We estimated the effect of primaquine on posttreatment gametocyte clearance and the total number of gametocyte-weeks as determined by microscopy. We compared the median area under the curve for gametocyte density and reported adverse events. One thousand three hundred thirty-five patients completed the antimalarial drug treatment. Adjusting for region, primaquine increased the rate of gametocyte clearance (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 3.3), prevented 45\% (95\% CI, 19 to 62) of posttreatment gametocyte-weeks, and decreased the area under the gametocyte density curve over the 28-day follow-up compared to AS+SP alone (P value = 0.01). The results were robust to other adjustment sets, and the estimated effect of primaquine increased during sensitivity analysis on the measurement of exposure time. No serious adverse events were detected. In conclusion, the addition of primaquine to AS+SP was effective in reducing the posttreatment presence of P. falciparum gametocytes. Primaquine was well tolerated and could be administered along with an artemisinin combination therapy as the first-line therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The final article in a series of three publications examining the global distribution of 41 dominant vector species (DVS) of malaria is presented here. The first publication examined the DVS from the Americas, with the second covering those species present in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Here we discuss the 19 DVS of the Asian-Pacific region. This region experiences a high diversity of vector species, many occurring sympatrically, which, combined with the occurrence of a high number of species complexes and suspected species complexes, and behavioural plasticity of many of these major vectors, adds a level of entomological complexity not comparable elsewhere globally. To try and untangle the intricacy of the vectors of this region and to increase the effectiveness of vector control interventions, an understanding of the contemporary distribution of each species, combined with a synthesis of the current knowledge of their behaviour and ecology is needed. RESULTS: Expert opinion (EO) range maps, created with the most up-to-date expert knowledge of each DVS distribution, were combined with a contemporary database of occurrence data and a suite of open access, environmental and climatic variables. Using the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) modelling method, distribution maps of each DVS were produced. The occurrence data were abstracted from the formal, published literature, plus other relevant sources, resulting in the collation of DVS occurrence at 10116 locations across 31 countries, of which 8853 were successfully geo-referenced and 7430 were resolved to spatial areas that could be included in the BRT model. A detailed summary of the information on the bionomics of each species and species complex is also presented. CONCLUSIONS: This article concludes a project aimed to establish the contemporary global distribution of the DVS of malaria. The three articles produced are intended as a detailed reference for scientists continuing research into the aspects of taxonomy, biology and ecology relevant to species-specific vector control. This research is particularly relevant to help unravel the complicated taxonomic status, ecology and epidemiology of the vectors of the Asia-Pacific region. All the occurrence data, predictive maps and EO-shape files generated during the production of these publications will be made available in the public domain. We hope that this will encourage data sharing to improve future iterations of the distribution maps.},

The within-host model is embedded in a P. vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites, and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P. vivax transmission. Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.},

Recent selective sweeps for drug-resistant genotypes may have restricted the genetic diversity of this parasite, resembling effects attributed in current debates to a historic population bottleneck.

Using 342 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers from a genetic map, here we show that the level of genetic diversity varies substantially among different regions of the parasite genome, revealing extensive linkage disequilibrium surrounding the key CQR gene pfcrt and at least four CQR founder events. This disequilibrium and its decay rate in the pfcrt-flanking region are consistent with strong directional selective sweeps occurring over only approximately 20-80 sexual generations, especially a single resistant pfcrt haplotype spreading to very high frequencies throughout most of Asia and Africa. The presence of linkage disequilibrium provides a basis for mapping genes under drug selection in P. falciparum.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration (MDA) has been proposed as an intervention to achieve local extinction of malaria. Although its effect on the reproduction number is short lived, extinction may subsequently occur in a small population due to stochastic fluctuations. This paper examines how the probability of stochastic extinction depends on population size, MDA coverage and the reproduction number under control, R c . A simple compartmental model is developed which is used to compute the probability of extinction using probability generating functions. The expected time to extinction in small populations after MDA for various scenarios in this model is calculated analytically. RESULTS: The results indicate that mass drug administration (Firstly, R c must be sustained at R c 95\% to have a non-negligible probability of successful elimination. Stochastic fluctuations only significantly affect the probability of extinction in populations of about 1000 individuals or less. The expected time to extinction via stochastic fluctuation is less than 10 years only in populations less than about 150 individuals. Clustering of secondary infections and of MDA distribution both contribute positively to the potential probability of success, indicating that MDA would most effectively be administered at the household level. CONCLUSIONS: There are very limited circumstances in which MDA will lead to local malaria elimination with a substantial probability.},

	abstract = {Malaria remains one of the greatest human health burdens in Indonesia. Although Indonesia has a long and renowned history in the early research and discoveries of malaria and subsequently in the successful use of environmental control methods to combat the vector, much remains unknown about many of these mosquito species. There are also significant gaps in the existing knowledge on the transmission epidemiology of malaria, most notably in the highly malarious eastern half of the archipelago. These compound the difficulty of developing targeted and effective control measures. The sheer complexity and number of malaria vectors in the country are daunting. The difficult task of summarizing the available information for each species and/or species complex is compounded by the patchiness of the data: while relatively plentiful in one area or region, it can also be completely lacking in others. Compared to many other countries in the Oriental and Australasian biogeographical regions, only scant information on vector bionomics and response to chemical measures is available in Indonesia. That information is often either decades old, geographically patchy or completely lacking. Additionally, a large number of information sources are published in Dutch or Indonesian language and therefore less accessible. This review aims to present an updated overview of the known distribution and bionomics of the 20 confirmed malaria vector species or species complexes regarded as either primary or secondary (incidental) malaria vectors within Indonesia. This chapter is not an exhaustive review of each of these species. No attempt is made to specifically discuss or resolve the taxonomic record of listed species in this document, while recognizing the ever evolving revisions in the systematics of species groups and complexes. A review of past and current status of insecticide susceptibility of eight vector species of malaria is also provided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Malaria elimination is being pursued in five of seven Central American countries. Military personnel returning from peacekeeping missions in sub-Saharan Africa could import chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, posing a threat to elimination and to the continued efficacy of first-line chloroquine (CQ) treatment in these countries. This report describes the importation of P. falciparum from among 150 Guatemalan army special forces and support staff who spent ten months on a United Nations' peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2010. METHODS:Investigators reviewed patients' medical charts and interviewed members of the contingent to identify malaria cases and risk factors for malaria acquisition. Clinical specimens were tested for malaria; isolated parasites were characterized molecularly for CQ resistance. RESULTS:Investigators identified 12 cases (8\%) of laboratory-confirmed P. falciparum infection within the contingent; one case was from a soldier infected with a CQ-resistant pfcrt genotype resulting in his death. None of the contingent used an insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) or completely adhered to malaria chemoprophylaxis while in the DRC. CONCLUSION:This report highlights the need to promote use of malaria prevention measures, in particular ITNs and chemoprophylaxis, among peacekeepers stationed in malaria-endemic areas. Countries attempting to eliminate malaria should consider appropriate methods to screen peacekeepers returning from endemic areas for malaria infections. Cases of malaria in travellers, immigrants and soldiers returning to Central America from countries with CQ-resistant malaria should be assumed to be carry resistant parasites and receive appropriate anti-malarial therapy to prevent severe disease and death.},

For a number of reasons, Plasmodium vivax became the parasite species most often employed for what became known as malariotherapy. This provided an opportunity, probably unique in the annals of medicine, to observe and investigate the biology, immunology and clinical evolution of a dangerous human pathogen in its natural host. There is little doubt that the lessons learned from these studies influenced the malaria research and control agendas. It is equally true that over the last 40 years, the insights afforded by malariotherapy have remained largely undisturbed on the dusty shelves of institutional libraries. In this chapter, we broadly review the published data derived from malariotherapy, and discuss its relevance to current challenges of P. vivax epidemiology, immunology and pathology.},

Blood meal size was ascertained by weight and subsequent fecundity was determined by the number of eggs laid on filter paper. In both small and large-bodied females there was a significant curvilinear component. We used this relationship to show that marginal returns from feeding decline as a function of current blood load.

	doi = {10.1186/1475-2875-13-330},
	abstract = {Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) interventions can reduce malaria transmission by targeting mosquitoes when they feed upon sleeping humans and/or rest inside houses, livestock shelters or other man-made structures. However, many malaria vector species can maintain robust transmission, despite high coverage of LLINs/IRS containing insecticides to which they are physiologically fully susceptible, because they exhibit one or more behaviours that define the biological limits of achievable impact with these interventions: (1) Natural or insecticide-induced avoidance of contact with treated surfaces within houses and early exit from them, thus minimizing exposure hazard of vectors which feed indoors upon humans; (2) Feeding upon humans when they are active and unprotected outdoors, thereby attenuating personal protection and any consequent community-wide suppression of transmission; (3) Feeding upon animals, thus minimizing contact with insecticides targeted at humans or houses; (4) Resting outdoors, away from insecticide-treated surfaces of nets, walls and roofs. Residual malaria transmission is, therefore, defined as all forms of transmission that can persist after achieving full universal coverage with effective LLINs and/or IRS containing active ingredients to which local vector populations are fully susceptible. Residual transmission is sufficiently intense across most of the tropics to render malaria elimination infeasible without new or improved vector control methods. Many novel or improved vector control strategies to address residual transmission are emerging that either: (1) Enhance control of adult vectors that enter houses to feed and/or rest by killing, repelling or excluding them; (2) Kill or repel adult mosquitoes when they attack people outdoors; (3) Kill adult mosquitoes when they attack livestock; (4) Kill adult mosquitoes when they feed upon sugar or; (5) Kill immature mosquitoes in aquatic habitats. To date, none of these options has sufficient supporting evidence to justify full-scale programmatic implementation. Concerted investment in their rigorous selection, development and evaluation is required over the coming decade to enable control and, ultimately, elimination of residual malaria transmission. In the meantime, national programmes may assess options for addressing residual transmission under programmatic conditions through pilot studies with strong monitoring, evaluation and operational research components, similar to the Onchocerciasis Control Programme.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Childhood anaemia is considered a severe public health problem in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the geographical distribution of prevalence of anaemia and mean haemoglobin concentration (Hb) in children aged 1-4 y (preschool children) in West Africa. The aim was to estimate the geographical risk profile of anaemia accounting for malnutrition, malaria, and helminth infections, the risk of anaemia attributable to these factors, and the number of anaemia cases in preschool children for 2011. METHODS AND FINDINGS:National cross-sectional household-based demographic health surveys were conducted in 7,147 children aged 1-4 y in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali in 2003-2006. Bayesian geostatistical models were developed to predict the geographical distribution of mean Hb and anaemia risk, adjusting for the nutritional status of preschool children, the location of their residence, predicted Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate in the 2- to 10-y age group (Pf PR(2-10)), and predicted prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium and hookworm infections. In the four countries, prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe anaemia was 21\%, 66\%, and 13\% in Burkina Faso; 28\%, 65\%, and 7\% in Ghana, and 26\%, 62\%, and 12\% in Mali. The mean Hb was lowest in Burkina Faso (89 g/l), in males (93 g/l), and for children 1-2 y (88 g/l). In West Africa, severe malnutrition, Pf PR(2-10), and biological synergisms between S. haematobium and hookworm infections were significantly associated with anaemia risk; an estimated 36.8\%, 14.9\%, 3.7\%, 4.2\%, and 0.9\% of anaemia cases could be averted by treating malnutrition, malaria, S. haematobium infections, hookworm infections, and S. haematobium/hookworm coinfections, respectively. A large spatial cluster of low mean Hb (95\%) was predicted for an area shared by Burkina Faso and Mali. We estimate that in 2011, approximately 6.7 million children aged 1-4 y are anaemic in the three study countries. CONCLUSIONS:By mapping the distribution of anaemia risk in preschool children adjusted for malnutrition and parasitic infections, we provide a means to identify the geographical limits of anaemia burden and the contribution that malnutrition and parasites make to anaemia. Spatial targeting of ancillary micronutrient supplementation and control of other anaemia causes, such as malaria and helminth infection, can contribute to efficiently reducing the burden of anaemia in preschool children in Africa.},

Here we provide an empirical approach to estimating the number of clinical events caused by Plasmodium falciparum worldwide, by using a combination of epidemiological, geographical and demographic data. We estimate that there were 515 (range 300-660) million episodes of clinical P. falciparum malaria in 2002.

Urban inhabitants enjoy better health on average than their rural counterparts, but the benefits are usually greater for the rich than for the poor, thus magnifying the differences between them. Subject to better evidence, I suggest that the main obstacles to improving urban health are not technical or even financial, but rather are related to governance and the organization of civil society.},

This review briefly examines some of the important historical examples of these disease and vector movements, such as the global influenza pandemics, the devastating Anopheles gambiae invasion of Brazil and the recent increases in imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases. We then outline potential approaches for future studies of disease movement, focussing on vector invasion and vector-borne disease importation.

However, these metrics showed strong explanatory power to predict mosquito larval abundances after stratification by water body type, with a clear seasonal trend for each, defined on the basis of its geomorphological setting and origin. ConclusionHydrological and geomorphological processes governing the availability and productivity of Anopheles breeding habitat need to be understood at the local scale for which larval source management is implemented in order to effectively target larval source interventions.

	abstract = {Malaria transmission is strongly associated with location. This association has two main features. First, the disease is focused around specific mosquito breeding sites and can normally be transmitted only within certain distances from them: in Africa these are typically between a few hundred metres and a kilometre and rarely exceed 2-3 kilometres. Second, there is a marked clustering of persons with malaria parasites and clinical symptoms at particular sites, usually households. In localities of low endemicity the level of malaria risk or case incidence may vary widely between households because the specific characteristics of houses and their locations affect contact between humans and vectors. Where endemicity is high, differences in human/vector contact rates between different households may have less effect on malaria case incidences. This is because superinfection and exposure-acquired immunity blur the proportional relationship between inoculation rates and case incidences. Accurate information on the distribution of malaria on the ground permits interventions to be targeted towards the foci of transmission and the locations and households of high malaria risk within them. Such targeting greatly increases the effectiveness of control measures. On the other hand, the inadvertent exclusion of these locations causes potentially effective control measures to fail. The computerized mapping and management of location data in geographical information systems should greatly assist the targeting of interventions against malaria at the focal and household levels, leading to improved effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of control.},

	abstract = {Social networks can be organized into communities of closely connected nodes, a property known as modularity. Because diseases, information, and behaviors spread faster within communities than between communities, understanding modularity has broad implications for public policy, epidemiology and the social sciences. Explanations for community formation in social networks often incorporate the attributes of individual people, such as gender, ethnicity or shared activities. High modularity is also a property of large-scale social networks, where each node represents a population of individuals at a location, such as call flow between mobile phone towers. However, whether or not place-based attributes, including land cover and economic activity, can predict community membership for network nodes in large-scale networks remains unknown. We describe the pattern of modularity in a mobile phone communication network in the Dominican Republic, and use a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to determine whether geographic context can explain community membership. Our results demonstrate that place-based attributes, including sugar cane production, urbanization, distance to the nearest airport, and wealth, correctly predicted community membership for over 70\% of mobile phone towers. We observed a strongly positive correlation (r = 0.97) between the modularity score and the predictive ability of the LDA, suggesting that place-based attributes can accurately represent the processes driving modularity. In the absence of social network data, the methods we present can be used to predict community membership over large scales using solely place-based attributes.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Malaria has recently been identified as a candidate for global eradication. This process will take the form of a series of national eliminations. Key issues must be considered specifically for elimination strategy when compared to the control of disease. Namely the spread of drug resistance, data scarcity and the adverse effects of failed elimination attempts. Mathematical models of various levels of complexity have been produced to consider the control and elimination of malaria infection. If available, detailed data on malaria transmission (such as the vector life cycle and behaviour, human population behaviour, the acquisition and decay of immunity, heterogeneities in transmission intensity, age profiles of clinical and subclinical infection) can be used to populate complex transmission models that can then be used to design control strategy. However, in many malaria countries reliable data are not available and policy must be formed based on information like an estimate of the average parasite prevalence. METHODS:A simple deterministic model, that requires data in the form of a single estimate of parasite prevalence as an input, is developed for the purpose of comparison with other more complex models. The model is designed to include key aspects of malaria transmission and integrated control. RESULTS:The simple model is shown to have similar short-term dynamic behaviour to three complex models. The model is used to demonstrate the potential of alternative methods of delivery of controls. The adverse effects on clinical infection and spread of resistance are predicted for failed elimination attempts. Since elimination strategies present an increased risk of the spread of drug resistance, the model is used to demonstrate the population level protective effect of multiple controls against this very serious threat. CONCLUSION:A simple model structure for the elimination of malaria is suitable for situations where data are sparse yet strategy design requirements are urgent with the caveat that more complex models, populated with new data, would provide more information, especially in the long-term.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Anopheles arabiensis is stereotypical of diverse vectors that mediate residual malaria transmission globally, because it can feed outdoors upon humans or cattle, or enter but then rapidly exit houses without fatal exposure to insecticidal nets or sprays. METHODS:Life histories of a well-characterized An. arabiensis population were simulated with a simple but process-explicit deterministic model and relevance to other vectors examined through sensitivity analysis. RESULTS:Where most humans use bed nets, two thirds of An. arabiensis blood feeds and half of malaria transmission events were estimated to occur outdoors. However, it was also estimated that most successful feeds and almost all ({\textgreater}98 \%) transmission events are preceded by unsuccessful attempts to attack humans indoors. The estimated proportion of vector blood meals ultimately obtained from humans indoors is dramatically attenuated by availability of alternative hosts, or partial ability to attack humans outdoors. However, the estimated proportion of mosquitoes old enough to transmit malaria, and which have previously entered a house at least once, is far less sensitive to both variables. For vectors with similarly modest preference for cattle over humans and similar ability to evade fatal indoor insecticide exposure once indoors, {\textgreater}80 \% of predicted feeding events by mosquitoes old enough to transmit malaria are preceded by at least one house entry event, so long as \${\textbackslash}ge\$40 \% of attempts to attack humans occur indoors and humans outnumber cattle \${\textbackslash}ge\$4-fold. CONCLUSIONS:While the exact numerical results predicted by such a simple deterministic model should be considered only approximate and illustrative, the derived conclusions are remarkably insensitive to substantive deviations from the input parameter values measured for this particular An. arabiensis population. This life-history analysis, therefore, identifies a clear, broadly-important opportunity for more effective suppression of residual malaria transmission by An. arabiensis in Africa and other important vectors of residual transmission across the tropics. Improved control of predominantly outdoor residual transmission by An. arabiensis, and other modestly zoophagic vectors like Anopheles darlingi, which frequently enter but then rapidly exit from houses, may be readily achieved by improving existing technology for killing mosquitoes indoors.},

DESIGN:Problem identification based on descriptive studies, point-prevalence surveys, and case-control studies and followed by specific interventions and evaluation of the response to these interventions. SETTING:University medical center. PARTICIPANTS:All patients hospitalized between May 1992 and June 1994 (59,196 admissions). MAIN RESULTS:75 active infections attributed to vancomycin-resistant enterococci were identified. Thirty-one patients (41\%) had bloodstream infections and 6 (8\%) died. The incidence of active infection was highest in the organ transplantation unit (13.2 infections/1000 admissions). In the point-prevalence studies, vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated from 20\% of a random sample of hospitalized patients in July, August, and September 1993 (adjusted prevalence, 16.9\%). Case-control studies showed significant associations between colonization and infection and 1) receipt of antimicrobial agents, particularly vancomycin, and 2) severity of illness. Although several small case clusters had isolates with identical banding patterns on pulsed field gel electrophoresis, at least 45 different banding patterns were noted among medical center isolates. Interventions took place in November and December 1993. Vancomycin restriction policies resulted in a 59\% decrease in intravenous vancomycin use and an 85\% decrease in oral vancomycin use. Point-prevalence surveys done in April, May, and June 1994 showed a consistent 20\% level of colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci strains (adjusted prevalence, 18.7\%). No significant changes were seen in rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection. CONCLUSIONS:Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are an important cause of illness and death in the study institution, particularly among organ transplant recipients and other seriously ill persons; they have also become a common intestinal colonizer among hospitalized patients. The diversity of isolates (based on molecular typing studies) suggests that resistant organisms have been introduced from multiple sources. Interventions that effectively lower the overall level of colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci must still be identified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The number of Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases around the world has decreased substantially over the last 15 years, but with the spread of resistance against anti-malarial drugs and insecticides, this decline may not continue. There is an urgent need to consider alternative, accelerated strategies to eliminate malaria in countries like Lao PDR, where there are a few remaining endemic areas. A deterministic compartmental modelling tool was used to develop an integrated strategy for P. falciparum elimination in the Savannakhet province of Lao PDR. The model was designed to include key aspects of malaria transmission and integrated control measures, along with a user-friendly interface. RESULTS:Universal coverage was the foundation of the integrated strategy, which took the form of the deployment of community health workers who provided universal access to early diagnosis, treatment and long-lasting insecticidal nets. Acceleration was included as the deployment of three monthly rounds of mass drug administration targeted towards high prevalence villages, with the addition of three monthly doses of the RTS,S vaccine delivered en masse to the same high prevalence sub-population. A booster dose of vaccine was added 1 year later. The surveillance-as-intervention component of the package involved the screening and treatment of individuals entering the simulated population. CONCLUSIONS:In this modelling approach, the sequential introduction of a series of five available interventions in an integrated strategy was predicted to be sufficient to stop malaria transmission within a 3-year period. These interventions comprised universal access to early diagnosis and adequate treatment, improved access to long-lasting insecticidal nets, three monthly rounds of mass drug administration together with RTS,S vaccination followed by a booster dose of vaccine, and screening and treatment of imported cases.},

However, the population-level impacts of ACTs on reducing malaria transmission have been difficult to assess. In this study on the history of malaria control in Vietnam, we assemble annual reporting on malaria case counts, coverage with insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), and drug purchases by provincial malaria control programs from 1991 to 2010 in Vietnam's 20 southern provinces. We observe a significant negative association between artemisinin use and malaria incidence, with a 10\% absolute increase in the purchase proportion of artemisinin-containing regimens being associated with a 29.1\% (95\% confidence interval: 14.8-41.0\%) reduction in slide-confirmed malaria incidence, after accounting for changes in urbanization, ITN/IRS coverage, and two indicators of health system capacity. One budget-related indicator of health system capacity was found to have a smaller association with malaria incidence, and no other significant factors were found. Our findings suggest that including an artemisinin component in malaria drug regimens was strongly associated with reduced malaria incidence in southern Vietnam, whereas changes in urbanization and coverage with ITN or IRS were not.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:High coverage of personal protection measures that kill mosquitoes dramatically reduce malaria transmission where vector populations depend upon human blood. However, most primary malaria vectors outside of sub-Saharan Africa can be classified as “very zoophagic,” meaning they feed occasionally ({\textless}10\% of blood meals) upon humans, so personal protection interventions have negligible impact upon their survival. METHODS AND FINDINGS:We extended a published malaria transmission model to examine the relationship between transmission, control, and the baseline proportion of bloodmeals obtained from humans (human blood index). The lower limit of the human blood index enables derivation of simplified models for zoophagic vectors that (1) Rely on only three field-measurable parameters. (2) Predict immediate and delayed (with and without assuming reduced human infectivity, respectively) impacts of personal protection measures upon transmission. (3) Illustrate how appreciable indirect communal-level protection for non-users can be accrued through direct personal protection of users. (4) Suggest the coverage and efficacy thresholds required to attain epidemiological impact. The findings suggest that immediate, indirect, community-wide protection of users and non-users alike may linearly relate to the efficacy of a user's direct personal protection, regardless of whether that is achieved by killing or repelling mosquitoes. High protective coverage and efficacy (\${\textbackslash}ge\$80\%) are important to achieve epidemiologically meaningful impact. Non-users are indirectly protected because the two most common species of human malaria are strict anthroponoses. Therefore, the small proportion of mosquitoes that are killed or diverted while attacking humans can represent a large proportion of those actually transmitting malaria. CONCLUSIONS:Simplified models of malaria transmission by very zoophagic vectors may be used by control practitioners to predict intervention impact interventions using three field-measurable parameters; the proportion of human exposure to mosquitoes occurring when an intervention can be practically used, its protective efficacy when used, and the proportion of people using it.},

	abstract = {Recently, the Vaccines to Vaccinate (v2V) initiative was reconfigured into the Partnership for Dengue Control (PDC), a multi-sponsored and independent initiative. This redirection is consistent with the growing consensus among the dengue-prevention community that no single intervention will be sufficient to control dengue disease. The PDC's expectation is that when an effective dengue virus (DENV) vaccine is commercially available, the public health community will continue to rely on vector control because the two strategies complement and enhance one another. Although the concept of integrated intervention for dengue prevention is gaining increasingly broader acceptance, to date, no consensus has been reached regarding the details of how and what combination of approaches can be most effectively implemented to manage disease. To fill that gap, the PDC proposed a three step process: (1) a critical assessment of current vector control tools and those under development, (2) outlining a research agenda for determining, in a definitive way, what existing tools work best, and (3) determining how to combine the best vector control options, which have systematically been defined in this process, with DENV vaccines. To address the first step, the PDC convened a meeting of international experts during November 2013 in Washington, DC, to critically assess existing vector control interventions and tools under development. This report summarizes those deliberations.},

Malaria elimination strategies may be unsuccessful if they focus only on vector biology, and ignore the mobility patterns of humans, particularly where the majority of infections are imported. In the first study in Mpumalanga Province in South Africa designed for this purpose, a metapopulation model is developed to assess the impact of their proposed elimination-focused policy interventions. A stochastic, non-linear, ordinary-differential equation model is fitted to malaria data from Mpumalanga and neighbouring Maputo Province in Mozambique. Further scaling-up of vector control is predicted to lead to a minimal reduction in local infections, while mass drug administration and focal screening and treatment at the Mpumalanga-Maputo border are predicted to have only a short-lived impact. Source reduction in Maputo Province is predicted to generate large reductions in local infections through stemming imported infections. The mathematical model predicts malaria elimination to be possible only when imported infections are treated before entry or eliminated at the source suggesting that a regionally focused strategy appears needed, for achieving malaria elimination in Mpumalanga and South Africa.},

Resistant haplotypes were clustered into subpopulations: one in the northeast DRC, and the other in the balance of the DRC. Network and clonal lineage analyses of the flanking microsatellites indicate that geographically-distinct mutant dhps haplotypes derive from separate lineages. The DRC is therefore a watershed for haplotypes associated with sulfadoxine resistance. Given the importance of central Africa as a corridor for the spread of antimalarial resistance, the identification of the mechanisms of this transit can inform future policies to contain drug-resistant parasite strains.},

However, the geographical relationship between the transmission intensity of malaria and associated HbS burden has never been formally investigated on a global scale. Here, we use a comprehensive data assembly of HbS allele frequencies to generate the first evidence-based map of the worldwide distribution of the gene in a Bayesian geostatistical framework. We compare this map with the pre-intervention distribution of malaria endemicity, using a novel geostatistical area-mean comparison. We find geographical support for the malaria hypothesis globally; the relationship is relatively strong in Africa but cannot be resolved in the Americas or in Asia.},

METHODS:Comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, WHOLIS, MedCarib and CENTRAL, and a manual search of reference lists from identified studies. Duplicates were removed and abstracts assessed for selection. All field evaluations of peridomestic space spraying targeting wild adult Aedes vectors in dengue endemic countries were included. Data were extracted, and the methodological quality of the studies was assessed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS:Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Outcome measures were heterogeneous, foregoing the possibility of meta-analysis. Thirteen studies showed reductions in immature entomological indices that were not sustained for long periods. The remainder showed space spray interventions to be ineffective at reducing adult and/or immature entomological indices. Only one study measured human disease indicators, but its outcomes could not be directly attributed to space sprays alone. CONCLUSION:Although peridomestic space spraying is commonly applied by national dengue control programmes, there are very few studies evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention. There is no clear evidence for recommending peridomestic space spraying as a single, effective control intervention. Thus, peridomestic space spraying is more likely best applied as part of an integrated vector management strategy. The effectiveness of this intervention should be measured in terms of impact on both adult and immature mosquito populations, as well as on disease transmission.},

	abstract = {Eliminating malaria from highly endemic settings will require unprecedented levels of vector control. To suppress mosquito populations, vector control products targeting their blood hosts must attain high biological coverage of all available sources, rather than merely high demographic coverage of a targeted resource subset, such as humans while asleep indoors. Beyond defining biological coverage in a measurable way, the proportion of blood meals obtained from humans and the proportion of bites upon unprotected humans occurring indoors also suggest optimal target product profiles for delivering insecticides to humans or livestock. For vectors that feed only occasionally upon humans, preferred animal hosts may be optimal targets for mosquito-toxic insecticides, and vapour-phase insecticides optimized to maximize repellency, rather than toxicity, may be ideal for directly protecting people against indoor and outdoor exposure. However, for vectors that primarily feed upon people, repellent vapour-phase insecticides may be inferior to toxic ones and may undermine the impact of contact insecticides applied to human sleeping spaces, houses or clothing if combined in the same time and place. These concepts are also applicable to other mosquito-borne anthroponoses so that diverse target species could be simultaneously controlled with integrated vector management programmes. Measurements of these two crucial mosquito behavioural parameters should now be integrated into programmatically funded, longitudinal, national-scale entomological monitoring systems to inform selection of available technologies and investment in developing new ones.},

However, the sources and scale of error inherent in this technique have not been systematically investigated. Here we use data collected in outpatient clinics in Peru and Thailand to elucidate important sources of variation in parasite density measurements. We show that discrepancies between readings from two independent microscopists and multiple readings from a single microscopist are inversely related to the density of the infection. We present an example of how differences in reader technique, specifically the number of white blood cells counted, can contribute to the differences between readings.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The impact of weather and climate on malaria transmission has attracted considerable attention in recent years, yet uncertainties around future disease trends under climate change remain. Mathematical models provide powerful tools for addressing such questions and understanding the implications for interventions and eradication strategies, but these require realistic modeling of the vector population dynamics and its response to environmental variables. METHODS:Published and unpublished field and experimental data are used to develop new formulations for modeling the relationships between key aspects of vector ecology and environmental variables. These relationships are integrated within a validated deterministic model of Anopheles gambiae s.s. population dynamics to provide a valuable tool for understanding vector response to biotic and abiotic variables. RESULTS:A novel, parsimonious framework for assessing the effects of rainfall, cloudiness, wind speed, desiccation, temperature, relative humidity and density-dependence on vector abundance is developed, allowing ease of construction, analysis, and integration into malaria transmission models. Model validation shows good agreement with longitudinal vector abundance data from Tanzania, suggesting that recent malaria reductions in certain areas of Africa could be due to changing environmental conditions affecting vector populations. CONCLUSIONS:Mathematical models provide a powerful, explanatory means of understanding the role of environmental variables on mosquito populations and hence for predicting future malaria transmission under global change. The framework developed provides a valuable advance in this respect, but also highlights key research gaps that need to be resolved if we are to better understand future malaria risk in vulnerable communities.},

	abstract = {Malaria can, a priori, kill on its own ('direct' malaria mortality) or in conjunction with some other cause(s) ('indirect' malaria mortality). There are three distinct approaches to the measurement of malaria mortality: (1) measurement of malaria-specific mortality (based on attributing each death to a single cause) or its surrogate, the admission rate for life-threatening malaria; (2) measurement of the reduction in all-cause mortality after removal (or near removal) of malaria; and (3) the estimation of the malaria mortality required to explain the observed frequency of the HbS gene. There is a strong indication that approaches (2) and (3) yield estimates of total (direct and indirect) malaria mortality which are at least twice as high as those obtained using approach (1), which probably measures mostly direct malaria mortality. There is currently a controversy about the long-term impact on mortality of reducing the intensity of malaria transmission from 'high' to 'intermediate', given the expected loss of immunity. Certain geographical comparisons (of the results of 'nature's experiment') indicate that, when the intensity of transmission is high, the incidence of life-threatening malaria falls. However, the seasonal variation in the intensity of transmission decreases with increases in the intensity; low seasonal variation is probably beneficial, allowing a smoother transition from passive to active immunity, but is unlikely to be reversed by preventive measures. It also seems likely that geographical comparisons produce estimates of predominantly direct mortality, which might not run in parallel with the indirect mortality. A tentative numerical exploration of the problem, using a simple demographic model, indicates that, if indirect malaria mortality is important and the other causes of death are concentrated in early life, the long-term impact on all-cause mortality of reducing exposure (although less than the short-term) will probably always be beneficial, even if there is some increase in direct malaria mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa. International effort and funding for control has been stepped up, with substantial increases from 2003 in the delivery of malaria interventions to pregnant women and children younger than 5 years in The Gambia. We investigated the changes in malaria indices in this country, and the causes and public-health significance of these changes. METHODS:We undertook a retrospective analysis of original records to establish numbers and proportions of malaria inpatients, deaths, and blood-slide examinations at one hospital over 9 years (January, 1999-December, 2007), and at four health facilities in three different administrative regions over 7 years (January, 2001-December, 2007). We obtained additional data from single sites for haemoglobin concentrations in paediatric admissions and for age distribution of malaria admissions. FINDINGS:From 2003 to 2007, at four sites with complete slide examination records, the proportions of malaria-positive slides decreased by 82\% (3397/10861 in 2003 to 337/6142 in 2007), 85\% (137/1259 to 6/368), 73\% (3664/16932 to 666/11333), and 50\% (1206/3304 to 336/1853). At three sites with complete admission records, the proportions of malaria admissions fell by 74\% (435/2530 to 69/1531), 69\% (797/2824 to 89/1032), and 27\% (2204/4056 to 496/1251). Proportions of deaths attributed to malaria in two hospitals decreased by 100\% (seven of 115 in 2003 to none of 117 in 2007) and 90\% (22/122 in 2003 to one of 58 in 2007). Since 2004, mean haemoglobin concentrations for all-cause admissions increased by 12 g/L (85 g/L in 2000-04 to 97 g/L in 2005-07), and mean age of paediatric malaria admissions increased from 3.9 years (95\% CI 3.7-4.0) to 5.6 years (5.0-6.2). INTERPRETATION:A large proportion of the malaria burden has been alleviated in The Gambia. Our results encourage consideration of a policy to eliminate malaria as a public-health problem, while emphasising the importance of accurate and continuous surveillance.},

This assumption maximizes the calculated impact of the insecticide on the vectorial capacity. An alternative assumption, namely that the vector population is composed of two subpopulations, one endophilic and exposed, the other exophilic and not exposed, leads to a much smaller calculated impact of insecticide on the vectorial capacity. This is illustrated with data collected before and after application of propoxur in the Garki District, Kano State, Nigeria. These data were also used to estimate, on the one hand, before spraying, the proportion of blood meals taken by Anopheles gambiae s.l. on man that are followed by rest indoors, and on the other hand, after spraying, the proportion exposed after the first blood meal, according to the model of non-uniform exposure; the two estimates agree fairly well. The discussion compares the models of uniform and non-uniform exposure in terms of plausibility and concludes that the latter is more realistic. It is therefore prudent to take it into account when evaluating the impact of insecticides on the transmission of malaria.},

This deviates from the popular view of regular cycles with a 10-20 year period. A deterministic mathematical model of kala-azar is used to find the simplest explanation for the timing of the 3 epidemics, paying particular attention to the role of extrinsic (drugs, natural disasters, other infectious diseases) versus intrinsic (host and vector dynamics, birth and death rates, immunity) processes in provoking the second. We conclude that, whilst widespread influenza in 1918-1919 may have magnified the second epidemic, intrinsic population processes provide the simplest explanation for its timing and synchrony throughout Assam. The model also shows that the second inter-epidemic period is expected to be shorter than the first, even in the absence of extrinsic agents, and highlights the importance of a small fraction of patients becoming chronically infectious (with post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis) after treatment during an epidemic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The burden of falciparum malaria remains unacceptably high in much of sub-Saharan Africa and massive efforts are underway to eliminate the parasite. While symptoms of malaria are caused by asexual reproduction of the parasite, transmission to new human hosts relies entirely on male and female sexual-stage parasites, known as gametocytes. Successful transmission can be observed at very low gametocyte densities, which raises the question of whether transmission-enhancing mechanisms exist in the human host, the mosquito, or both. METHODS:A new computational model was developed to investigate the probability of fertilization over a range of overdispersion parameters and male gamete exploration rates. Simulations were used to fit a likelihood surface for data on rates of mosquito infection across a wide range of host gametocyte densities. RESULTS:The best fit simultaneously requires very strong overdispersion and faster gamete exploration than is possible with random swimming in order to explain typical prevalence levels in mosquitoes. Gametocyte overdispersion or clustering in the human host and faster gamete exploration of the mosquito blood meal are highly probably given these results. CONCLUSIONS:Density-dependent gametocyte clustering in the human host, and non-random searching (e.g., chemotaxis) in the mosquito are probable. Future work should aim to discover these mechanisms, as disrupting parasite development in the mosquito will play a critical role in eliminating malaria.},

Mosquitoes frequently became infected when fed on gametocyte densities of less than 10 per cmm. of blood, and were infected as late as day 321 of parasite patency in the South Carolina strain, and 410 in the Panama strain. It is concluded that the long enduring parasitemias of these South Carolina and Panama strains of P. falciparum are of considerable epidemiological importance and may be responsible for a large part of the transmission of this species in certain endemic areas.},

Overall the current literature suggests behavioral and species changes may be emerging, but the data are sparse and, at times unconvincing. However, preliminary modeling has demonstrated that behavioral resistance could have significant impacts on the effectiveness of malaria control. We propose seven recommendations to improve understanding of resistance in malaria vectors.

	abstract = {In areas of the world where malaria prevails under unstable conditions, attacking the adult vector population through insecticide-based Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is the most common method for controlling epidemics. Defined in policy guidance, the use of Annual Parasitic Incidence (API) is an important tool for assessing the effectiveness of control and for planning new interventions. To investigate the consequences that a policy based on API in previous seasons might have on the population dynamics of the disease and on control itself in regions of low and seasonal transmission, we formulate a mathematical malaria model that couples epidemiologic and vector dynamics with IRS intervention. This model is parameterized for a low transmission and semi-arid region in northwest India, where epidemics are driven by high rainfall variability. We show that this type of feedback mechanism in control strategies can generate transient cycles in malaria even in the absence of environmental variability, and that this tendency to cycle can in turn limit the effectiveness of control in the presence of such variability. Specifically, for realistic rainfall conditions and over a range of control intensities, the effectiveness of such 'reactive' intervention is compared to that of an alternative strategy based on rainfall and therefore vector variability. Results show that the efficacy of intervention is strongly influenced by rainfall variability and the type of policy implemented. In particular, under an API 'reactive' policy, high vector populations can coincide more frequently with low control coverage, and in so doing generate large unexpected epidemics and decrease the likelihood of elimination. These results highlight the importance of incorporating information on climate variability, rather than previous incidence, in planning IRS interventions in regions of unstable malaria. These findings are discussed in the more general context of elimination and other low transmission regions such as highlands.},

They are based for the most part on the results of some anti-mosquito work done at Mian Mir by Dr. Christophers and Captain James. Perhaps those of your readers who are not medical men may not be cognisant of the fact that an exhaustive and, I think, destructive criticism of this work has been published by Colonels Crombie and Giles, Captain Sewell, and myself—vide British Medical Journal, September 17, 1904, and Journal of Tropical Medicine, 1904. My own conclusions were that the operations cost too little to be effective, and that no exact method was employed for enumerating the numbers of mosquitoes present before and after their commencement. So far as I am aware, Dr. Christophers and Captain James have not replied to our criticisms, and I therefore feel justified in assuming that the case has gone against them by default. I should add that I hear on very good authority that the operations at Mian Mir are now being continued on a better basis.},

In part, this situation is due to the considerable demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental heterogeneity of large and growing urban centers. Despite this heterogeneity, the influence of climate variability on the population dynamics of infectious diseases is considered a large-scale, regional, phenomenon, and as such has been previously addressed for cholera only with temporal models that do not incorporate spatial structure. Here we show that a probabilistic spatial model can explain cholera dynamics in the megacity of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and afford a basis for cholera forecasts at lead times of 11 mo. Critically, we find that the action of climate variability (El Niño southern oscillation and flooding) is quite localized: There is a climate-sensitive urban core that acts to propagate risk to the rest of the city. The modeling framework presented here should be applicable to cholera in other cities, as well as to other infectious diseases in urban settings and other biological systems with spatiotemporal interactions.},

We used a mathematical model of within-host virus evolution to study factors that could increase and decrease the probability of the remaining substitutions evolving after the virus has infected a mammalian host. These factors, combined with the presence of some of these substitutions in circulating strains, make a virus evolving in nature a potentially serious threat.

Focusing on Nigeria, we use nationally representative household surveys and their cluster locations to predict the proportion of the under-five population in 1 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 1 km using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model. Results showed that land cover, travel time to major settlements, night-time lights and vegetation index were good predictors and that accounting for fine-scale variation, rather than assuming a uniform proportion of under 5 year olds can result in significant differences in health metrics. The largest gaps in estimated bednet and vaccination coverage were in Kano, Katsina and Jigawa. Geolocated household surveys are a valuable resource for providing detailed, contemporary and regularly updated population age-structure data in the absence of recent census data. By combining these with covariate layers, age-structure maps of unprecedented detail can be produced to guide the targeting of interventions in resource-poor settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are highly effective tools for controlling malaria transmission in Africa because the most important vectors, from the Anopheles gambiae complex and the A. funestus group, usually prefer biting humans indoors at night. METHODS:Matched surveys of mosquito and human behaviour from six rural sites in Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Zambia, and Kenya, with ITN use ranging from 0.2\% to 82.5\%, were used to calculate the proportion of human exposure to An. gambiae sensu lato and An. funestus s.l. that occurs indoors (πi), as an indicator of the upper limit of personal protection that indoor vector control measures can provide. This quantity was also estimated through use of a simplified binary analysis (π(i)(B)) so that the proportions of mosquitoes caught indoors (Pi), and between the first and last hours at which most people are indoors (Pfl) could also be calculated as underlying indicators of feeding by mosquitoes indoors or at night, respectively. RESULTS:The vast majority of human exposure to Anopheles bites occurred indoors (π(i)(B)= 0.79-1.00). Neither An. gambiae s.l. nor An. funestus s.l. strongly preferred feeding indoors (P(i) = 0.40-0.63 and 0.22-0.69, respectively), but they overwhelmingly preferred feeding at times when most humans were indoors (P(fl) = 0.78-1.00 and 0.86-1.00, respectively). CONCLUSIONS:These quantitative summaries of behavioural interactions between humans and mosquitoes constitute a remarkably consistent benchmark with which future observations of vector behaviour can be compared. Longitudinal monitoring of these quantities is vital to evaluate the effectiveness of ITNs and IRS and the need for complementary measures that target vectors outdoors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large-scale mapping of Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence relies on opportunistic assemblies of infection prevalence data arising from thousands of P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys conducted worldwide. Variance in these data is driven by both signal, the true underlying pattern of infection prevalence, and a range of factors contributing to 'noise', including sampling error, differing age ranges of subjects and differing parasite detection methods. Whilst the former two noise components have been addressed in previous studies, the effect of different diagnostic methods used to determine PfPR in different studies has not. In particular, the majority of PfPR data are based on positivity rates determined by either microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RDT), yet these approaches are not equivalent; therefore a method is needed for standardizing RDT and microscopy-based prevalence estimates prior to use in mapping. METHODS: Twenty-five recent Demographic and Health surveys (DHS) datasets from sub-Saharan Africa provide child diagnostic test results derived using both RDT and microscopy for each individual. These prevalence estimates were aggregated across level one administrative zones and a Bayesian probit regression model fit to the microscopy- versus RDT-derived prevalence relationship. An errors-in-variables approach was employed to account for sampling error in both the dependent and independent variables. In addition to the diagnostic outcome, RDT type, fever status and recent anti-malarial treatment were extracted from the datasets in order to analyse their effect on observed malaria prevalence. RESULTS: A strong non-linear relationship between the microscopy and RDT-derived prevalence was found. The results of regressions stratified by the additional diagnostic variables (RDT type, fever status and recent anti-malarial treatment) indicate that there is a distinct and consistent difference in the relationship when the data are stratified by febrile status and RDT brand. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships defined in this research can be applied to RDT-derived PfPR data to effectively convert them to an estimate of the parasite prevalence expected using microscopy (or vice versa), thereby standardizing the dataset and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, the results provide insight on the importance of RDT brands, febrile status and recent anti-malarial treatment for explaining inconsistencies between observed prevalence derived from different diagnostics.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of an investigation into the utility of remote sensing (RS) using meteorological satellites sensors and spatial interpolation (SI) of data from meteorological stations, for the prediction of spatial variation in monthly climate across continental Africa in 1990. Information from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites was used to estimate land surface temperature (LST) and atmospheric moisture. Cold cloud duration (CCD) data derived from the High Resolution Radiometer (HRR) on-board the European Meteorological Satellite programme's (EUMETSAT) Meteosat satellite series were also used as a RS proxy measurement of rainfall. Temperature, atmospheric moisture and rainfall surfaces were independently derived from SI of measurements from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) member stations of Africa. These meteorological station data were then used to test the accuracy of each methodology, so that the appropriateness of the two techniques for epidemiological research could be compared. SI was a more accurate predictor of temperature, whereas RS provided a better surrogate for rainfall; both were equally accurate at predicting atmospheric moisture. The implications of these results for mapping short and long-term climate change and hence their potential for the study and control of disease vectors are considered. Taking into account logistic and analytical problems, there were no clear conclusions regarding the optimality of either technique, but there was considerable potential for synergy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Increasing volumes of data and computational capacity afford unprecedented opportunities to scale up infectious disease (ID) mapping for public health uses. Whilst a large number of IDs show global spatial variation, comprehensive knowledge of these geographic patterns is poor. Here we use an objective method to prioritise mapping efforts to begin to address the large deficit in global disease maps currently available. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Automation of ID mapping requires bespoke methodological adjustments tailored to the epidemiological characteristics of different types of diseases. Diseases were therefore grouped into 33 clusters based upon taxonomic divisions and shared epidemiological characteristics. Disability-adjusted life years, derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study, were used as a globally consistent metric of disease burden. A review of global health stakeholders, existing literature and national health priorities was undertaken to assess relative interest in the diseases. The clusters were ranked by combining both metrics, which identified 44 diseases of main concern within 15 principle clusters. Whilst malaria, HIV and tuberculosis were the highest priority due to their considerable burden, the high priority clusters were dominated by neglected tropical diseases and vector-borne parasites. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:A quantitative, easily-updated and flexible framework for prioritising diseases is presented here. The study identifies a possible future strategy for those diseases where significant knowledge gaps remain, as well as recognising those where global mapping programs have already made significant progress. For many conditions, potential shared epidemiological information has yet to be exploited.},

	abstract = {Vector control interventions have resulted in considerable reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality. When universal coverage cannot be achieved for financial or logistical reasons, the spatial arrangement of vector control is potentially important for optimizing benefits. This study investigated the effect of spatial clustering of vector control interventions on reducing the population of biting mosquitoes. A discrete-space continuous-time mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics and dispersal was extended to incorporate vector control interventions of insecticide treated bednets (ITNs), Indoor residual Spraying (IRS), and larviciding. Simulations were run at varying levels of coverage and degree of spatial clustering. At medium to high coverage levels of each of the interventions or in combination was more effective to spatially spread these interventions than to cluster them. Suggesting that when financial resources are limited, unclustered distribution of these interventions is more effective. Although it is often stated that locally high coverage is needed to achieve a community effect of ITNs or IRS, our results suggest that if the coverage of ITNs or IRS are insufficient to achieve universal coverage, and there is no targeting of high risk areas, the overall effects on mosquito densities are much greater if they are distributed in an unclustered way, rather than clustered in specific localities. Also, given that interventions are often delivered preferentially to accessible areas, and are therefore clustered, our model results show this may be inefficient. This study provides evidence that the effectiveness of an intervention can be highly dependent on its spatial distribution. Vector control plans should consider the spatial arrangement of any intervention package to ensure effectiveness is maximized.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Less than 5 years remain before the 2015 mark when countries will be evaluated on their achievements for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDG 4 and 6 call for a reduction of child mortality by two-thirds and combating malaria, HIV/AIDS, TB, and other diseases, respectively. To accelerate the achievement of these goals, focused allocation of resources and high deployment of cost-effective interventions is paramount. The knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution of diseases is important for health authorities to prioritize and allocate resources. METHODS:To identify possible significant clusters, we used SatTScan software, and analyzed 2,745 cases of under-five with 134,099 person-years for the period between 1999and 2008. Mortality rates for every year were calculated, likewise a spatial scan statistic was used to test for clusters of total under-five mortalities in both space and time. RESULTS:A number of significant clusters from space, time, and space-time analysis were identified in several locations for a period of 10 years in the Rufiji Demographic Surveillance Site (RDSS). These locations show that villages within the clusters have an elevated risk of under-five deaths. The spatial analysis identified three significant clusters. The first cluster had only one village, Kibiti A (p {\textless} 0.05, the second cluster involved five villages (Mtawanya, Pagae, Kibiti A, Machepe, and Kibiti B; p {\textless} 0.05), the third cluster involved one village, Jaribu Mpakani (p {\textless} 0.05). A space-time cluster of 10 villages for the period between 1999 and 2002 with a radius of 14.73 km was discovered with the highest risk (RR 1.6, p {\textless} 0.001). The mortality rates were very high for the years 1999-2002 according to the analysis. The death rates were 33.5, 26.4, 24.1, and 24.9, respectively. Total childhood mortality rates calculated for the period of 10 years were 21.0 per 1,000 person-years. CONCLUSION:During the 10 years of analysis, mortality seemed to decrease in RDSS. The mortality decline should be taken with caution because the Demographic Surveillance System is not statistically representative of the whole population; therefore, inference should not be made to the general population of Tanzania. The pattern observed could be attributed to demographic and weather characteristics of RDSS. This should provide new insights for further studies and interventions toward reducing under-five mortality.},

The diseases caused by these pathogens often show regular seasonal patterns in incidence because of the sensitivity of their mosquito vectors to climate. Between years in endemic areas, however, there can be further significant variation in case numbers for which public health systems are generally unprepared. There is an acute need for reliable predictions of within-year and between-year epidemic events. The prerequisite for developing any system of early warning is a detailed understanding of the factors involved in epidemic genesis. In this report we discuss the potential causes of the interepidemic periods in dengue hemorrhagic fever in Bangkok and of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a highland area of western Kenya. The alternative causes are distinguished by a retrospective analysis of two unique and contemporaneous 33-year time series of epidemiological and associated meteorological data recorded at these two sites. We conclude that intrinsic population dynamics offer the most parsimonious explanation for the observed interepidemic periods of disease in these locations.},

We fitted movement models to trip data from surveys conducted at 3-5 sites throughout each of Mali, Burkina Faso, Zambia and Tanzania. Two models were compared in terms of their ability to predict the observed movement patterns - a gravity model, in which movement rates between pairs of locations increase with population size and decrease with distance, and a radiation model, in which travelers are cumulatively “absorbed” as they move outwards from their origin of travel. The gravity model provided a better fit to the data overall and for travel to large populations, while the radiation model provided a better fit for nearby populations. One strength of the data set was that trips could be categorized according to traveler group - namely, women traveling with children in all survey countries and youth workers in Mali. For gravity models fitted to data specific to these groups, youth workers were found to have a higher travel frequency to large population centers, and women traveling with children a lower frequency. These models may help predict the spatial transmission of malaria parasites and inform strategies to control their spread.},

	abstract = {The evolution of antibiotic resistance (AR) increases treatment cost and probability of failure, threatening human health worldwide. The relative importance of individual antibiotic use, environmental transmission and rates of introduction of resistant bacteria in explaining community AR patterns is poorly understood. Evaluating their relative importance requires studying a region where they vary. The construction of a new road in a previously roadless area of northern coastal Ecuador provides a valuable natural experiment to study how changes in the social and natural environment affect the epidemiology of resistant
              Escherichia coli
              . We conducted seven bi-annual 15 day surveys of AR between 2003 and 2008 in 21 villages. Resistance to both ampicillin and sulphamethoxazole was the most frequently observed profile, based on antibiogram tests of seven antibiotics from 2210 samples. The prevalence of enteric bacteria with this resistance pair in the less remote communities was 80 per cent higher than in more remote communities (OR = 1.8 [1.3, 2.3]). This pattern could not be explained with data on individual antibiotic use. We used a transmission model to help explain this observed discrepancy. The model analysis suggests that both transmission and the rate of introduction of resistant bacteria into communities may contribute to the observed regional scale AR patterns, and that village-level antibiotic use rate determines which of these two factors predominate. While usually conceived as a main effect on individual risk, antibiotic use rate is revealed in this analysis as an effect modifier with regard to community-level risk of resistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria constitutes a major cause of morbidity in the Brazilian Amazon where an estimated 6 million people are considered at high risk of transmission. Indigenous peoples in the Amazon are particularly vulnerable to potentially epidemic disease such as malaria; notwithstanding, very little is known about the epidemiology of malaria in Indian reservations of the region. The aim of this paper is to present a spatial analysis of malaria cases over a four-year time period (2003-2006) among indigenous peoples of the Brazilian State of Rondônia, southwestern Amazon, by using passive morbidity data (results from Giemsa-stained thick blood smears) gathered from the National Malaria Epidemiologic Surveillance System databank. RESULTS: A total of 4,160 cases of malaria were recorded in 14 Indian reserves in the State of Rondônia between 2003 and 2006. In six reservations no cases of malaria were reported in the period. Overall, P. vivax accounted for 76.18 of malaria cases reported in the indigenous population of Rondônia. The P. vivax/P. falciparum ratio for the period was 3.78. Two reserves accounted for over half of the cases reported for the total indigenous population in the period–Roosevelt and Pacaas Novas–with a total of 1,646 (39.57\%) and 1,145 (27.52\%) cases, respectively. Kernel mapping of malaria mean Annual Parasite Index–API according to indigenous reserves and environmental zones revealed a heterogeneous pattern of disease distribution, with one clear area of high risk of transmission comprising reservations of west Rondônia along the Guaporé-Madeira River basins, and another high risk area to the east, on the Roosevelt reserve. CONCLUSION: By means of kernel mapping, it was shown that malaria risk varies widely between Indian reserves and environmental zones defined on the basis of predominant ecologic characteristics and land use patterns observed in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. The geographical approach in this paper helped to determine where the greatest needs lie for more intensively focused malaria control activities in Indian reserves in the region. It also provided a reference to assess the effectiveness of control measures that have been put in place by Brazilian public health authorities.},

A geometrical model of anemotactic searching is presented that takes into account variation in wind direction. It is shown, that, if wind direction fluctuates over a range larger than 30 degrees from the mean wind direction, then upwind or downwind searching is the best strategy and cross-wind searching is the worst of all possibilities.},

For most insects relatively little is known of the pattern of the preceding search flight which Haskell2 described as `wandering', but where the wind is light it may be upwind1. Experiments in West Africa have shown that the majority of mosquitoes entered flight traps from the downwind side, that is they appeared to have been flying upwind, regardless of the presence or absence of a host (ref. 10 and W. F. Snow, unpublished). Here we report experiments that unexpectedly provide evidence for the opposite type of behaviour.},

The selection of an oviposition site that guarantees egg and larval survival is a critical step in the reproductive process. The dangers associated with ephemeral aquatic habitats, lengthy droughts, freezing winters, and the absence of larval nutrition makes careful oviposition site selection by a female mosquito extremely important. Mosquito species exhibit a remarkable diversity of oviposition behaviors that ensure eggs are deposited into microenvironments conducive for successful larval development and the emergence of the next mosquito generation. An understanding of mosquito oviposition behavior is necessary for the development of surveillance and control opportunities directed against specific disease vectors. For example, Aedes aegypti Linnaeus is the vector of viruses causing important human diseases including yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The preference of this species to oviposit in natural and artificial containers has facilitated the development of Ae. aegypti-specific surveillance and toxic oviposition traps designed to detect and control this important vector species in and around disease foci. A better understanding of the wide diversity of mosquito oviposition behavior will allow the development of new and innovative surveillance and control devices directed against other important mosquito vectors of human and animal disease.},

	abstract = {Many West African mosquitoes fly at low levels when crossing open country. Experiments were therefore conducted in the Gambia on the effect of high fences on their dispersal. In the first experiment, a circular mosquito-proof fence 2-9 m high and with a radius of 18 m was constructed. Catches inside on human bait of Mansonia spp. were about 60 \% lower than catches outside the fence, whereas catches of Anopheles spp. in the two sites were not significantly different. In unbaited suction traps, catches of Mansonia inside the fence were significantly lower in traps 0 and 0-5 m above the ground, but not at 1 to 3 m, than in traps at similar levels outside. This suggested that, after flying over the fence, mosquitoes had not resumed normal flight levels by the time they were trapped in the centre of the circle. In a second experiment, a much larger fence was erected, 6 m high and with a radius of 65 m. Catches were conducted in experimental huts in the centre of the enclosed area and at a distance of 70 m outside it when the fence was erected and again after its removal. Catches of Mansonia spp. on human bait in the hut inside were 46\% of the total catch in the two huts when the fence was erected and 48 \% after its removal; catches of Anopheles spp. \{\vphantom{\}}A. gambiae Giles and A. funestus Giles) were 43\% with, and 53\% without, the fence. In calf-baited light-traps, catches of Mansonia were 41\% of the total with, and 38\% without, the fence, and those of Anopheles 58 and 44\%. Thus the presence of the 6-m fence had no significant effect on the density of mosquitoes in the centre of the enclosed area, and it is concluded that mosquitoes were flying freely over it. Due to the prevailing low winds in the area, passive transport of mosquitoes over the fence by the wind was not thought to be important.},

Adults of all species except Ae. sollicitans were taken in greater numbers in a large weathered plywood suction trap covered with black panels than in one without panels. However, both traps were attractive, as a transparent plastic suction trap covered with weathered plywood panels took larger numbers of all species except U. lowii than a transparent trap without panels. Buried suction traps furnished with visible risers (extensions) that made captures at 1·2 m elevations always captured proportionately larger numbers than buried traps with visible baffles that captured mosquitoes at ground level. A woodland species, C. nigripalpus, was captured in larger numbers toy traps furnisihed with visible risers and baffles than in traps furnished with transparent risers and baffles; however, collections of field species, e.g. Ae. taeniorhynchus, were smaller. The distribution of blood-fed and gravid females in collections from these traps provided some evidence that blood-seeking females are more responsive to visible objects than engorged or gravid females. These results are compatible with the hypotheses that (1) mosquitoes are attracted from a distance to visible objects, (2) in close proximity an avoidance action occurs and mosquitoes then pass over or around the visible object and (3) woodland species approach visible objects closely ({\textless}30 cm), whereas field species pass by at greater mean distances. Consequently, a larger percentage of visually attracted woodland mosquitoes than of visually attracted field species will be captured by suction traps.

	abstract = {Background
Africa is the hotspot for malaria transmission where more than 90\% of malaria deaths occur every year. The effect of climate change on malaria transmission in Africa has been controversial. Malaria is a major vector-borne parasitic disease transmitted to humans by Anopheles spp mosquitoes. Malaria transmission is an intricate function of climatic factors, which non-linearly affect the development of vectors and parasites. In this study, we aimed to project that the risk of malaria will increase towards the end of the 21st century in east Africa, but decrease in west Africa.
Methods
We combine a novel malaria transmission simulator, HYDREMATS, that has been developed based on comprehensive multi-year field surveys both in east Africa and west Africa, and the most reliable climate projections through regional dynamical downscaling and rigorous selection of global circulation models from among CMIP5 models.
Findings
We define a bell-shaped relation between malaria intensity and temperature, centered around a temperature of 28°C. Future risks of malaria are projected for two highly populated regions in Africa: the highlands in east Africa and the fringes of the desert in west Africa. In the highlands in east Africa, temperatures are substantially colder than this optimal temperature; warmer future climate exacerbate malaria conditions. In the Sahel fringes in west Africa, temperatures are around this optimal temperature; warming is not likely to exacerbate and might even reduce malaria burden. Unlike the highlands in east Africa, which receive major amounts of annual rainfall, dry conditions also limit malaria transmission in the Sahel fringes in west Africa.
Interpretation
The study shows disproportionate future risk of malaria due to climate change between east and west Africa, and should have an effect on guiding strategies for climate adaptation over Africa.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification and characterization of larval habitats, documentation of Anopheles spp. composition and abundance, and Plasmodium spp. infection burden are critical components of integrated vector management. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of landscape heterogeneity on entomological and parasitological indices of malaria in western Kenya.
METHODS: A cross-sectional entomological and parasitological survey was conducted along an altitudinal transect in three eco-epidemiological zones: lakeshore along the lakeside, hillside, and highland plateau during the wet and dry seasons in 2020 in Kisumu County, Kenya. Larval habitats for Anopheles mosquitoes were identified and characterized. Adult mosquitoes were sampled using pyrethrum spray catches (PSC). Finger prick blood samples were taken from residents and examined for malaria parasites by real-time PCR (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Increased risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection was associated with residency in the lakeshore zone, school-age children, rainy season, and no ITNs (χ2 = 41.201, df = 9, P {\textless} 0.0001). Similarly, lakeshore zone and the rainy season significantly increased Anopheles spp. abundance. However, house structures such as wall type and whether the eave spaces were closed or open, as well as the use of ITNs, did not affect Anopheles spp. densities in the homes (χ2 = 38.695, df = 7, P {\textless} 0.0001). Anopheles funestus (41.8\%) and An. arabiensis (29.1\%) were the most abundant vectors in all zones. Sporozoite prevalence was 5.6\% and 3.2\% in the two species respectively. The lakeshore zone had the highest sporozoite prevalence (4.4\%, 7/160) and inoculation rates (135.2 infective bites/person/year). High larval densities were significantly associated with lakeshore zone and hillside zones, animal hoof prints and tire truck larval habitats, wetland and pasture land, and the wet season. The larval habitat types differed significantly across the landscape zones and seasonality (χ2 = 1453.044, df = 298, P {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The empirical evidence on the impact of landscape heterogeneity and seasonality on vector densities, parasite transmission, and Plasmodium infections in humans emphasizes the importance of tailoring specific adaptive environmental management interventions to specific landscape attributes to have a significant impact on transmission reduction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria interventions over the last decades have been successful in reducing both mortality and morbidity. In western Kenya however some areas experience contrasting outcomes of the ongoing interventions while the causes for this observation remains not yet clearly known.
METHODS: The WHO insecticide (deltamethrin) susceptibility test of the common malaria vectors was studied. Multiple surveys on household use and hospital prescriptions of antimalarial drugs from 2003 to 2015 were done. Along with this, cross sectional surveys on their availability in the local drug dispensing outlets were also done in 2015. Monthly precipitations and air temperature data was collected along with systematic review on abundance and composition of common malaria vectors in the study area before and during interventions. The above factors were used to explain the possible causes of contrasting outcome of malaria interventions between the three study sites.
RESULTS: Areas with malaria resurgence or sustained high transmission (Kombewa and Marani) showed higher composition of Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.) than the previously abundant Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and the later had higher composition to an area with a sustained infection decline (Iguhu). Anopheles gambiae s.l. from Kombewa showed highest resistance (50\% mortality) upon exposure to WHO deltamethrin discriminating dosage of 0.75\% while those from Marani and Iguhu had reduced resistance status (both had a mean mortality of 91\%). Sampled An. funestus s.l. from Marani were also highly resistant to deltamethrin as 57\% of the exposed vectors survived. An increasing of mean air temperature by 2 °C was noted for Marani and Iguhu from 2013 to 2015 and was accompanied by an increased rainfall at Marani. Community drug use and availability in selling outlets along with prescription in hospitals were not linked to the struggling control of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The malaria vector species composition shift, insecticide resistance and climatic warming were the likely cause of the contrasting outcome of malaria intervention in western Kenya. Surveillance of malaria parasite and vector dynamics along with insecticide resistance and vector biting behaviour monitoring are highly recommended in these areas.},

	abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya, cause morbidity and mortality around the world. Recent advances in gene drives have produced control methods that could theoretically modify all populations of a disease vector, from a single release, making whole species less able to transmit pathogens. This ability has caused both excitement, at the prospect of global eradication of mosquito-borne diseases, and concern around safeguards. Drive mechanisms that require individuals to be released at high frequency before genes will spread can therefore be desirable as they are potentially localised and reversible. These include underdominance-based strategies and use of the reproductive parasite Wolbachia. Here, we review recent advances in practical applications and mathematical analyses of these threshold-dependent gene drives with a focus on implementation in Aedes aegypti, highlighting their mechanisms and the role of fitness costs on introduction frequencies. Drawing on the parallels between these systems offers useful insights into practical, controlled application of localised drives, and allows us to assess the requirements needed for gene drive reversal.},

	abstract = {The potential benefits and risks of genetically engineered gene-drive systems for replacing wild pest strains with more benign strains must be assessed prior to any field releases. We develop a computer simulation model to assess the feasibility of using engineered underdominance constructs to drive transgenes into age- and spatially structured mosquito populations. Our practical criterion for success is the achievement of a transgene frequency of at least 0.80 within 3 years of release. The impacts of a number of parameters that may affect the success of gene-drive, such as the release area, release age, density-dependent larval survival, fitness cost of the engineered genes, and migration probability of adults, are examined. Results show that patchy release generally requires the release of fewer engineered insects to achieve success than central release. When the fitness cost is very low, central release covering 25\% of the total area can be more effective than a completely uniform release over the whole area. This study demonstrates that to determine the best method of spatial release, and the total number of engineered insects that must be released, it is important to take into account the age and sex of the released insects and spatial structure of the population.},

	abstract = {Underdominance systems can quickly spread through a population, but only when introduced in considerable numbers. This promises a gene drive mechanism that is less invasive than homing drives, potentially enabling new approaches in the fight against vector-borne diseases. If regional confinement can indeed be achieved, the decision-making process for a release would likely be much simpler compared to other, more invasive types of drives. The capacity of underdominance gene drive systems to spread in a target population without invading other populations is typically assessed via network models of panmictic demes linked by migration. However, it remains less clear how such systems would behave in more realistic population models where organisms move over a continuous landscape. Here, we use individual-based simulations to study the dynamics of several proposed underdominance systems in continuous-space. We find that all these systems can fail to persist in such environments, even after an initially successful establishment in the release area, confirming previous theoretical results from diffusion theory. At the same time, we find that a two-locus two-toxin-antidote system can invade connected demes through a narrow migration corridor. This suggests that the parameter space where underdominance systems can establish and persist in a release area while at the same time remaining confined to that area could be quite limited, depending on how a population is spatially structured. Overall, these results indicate that realistic spatial context must be considered when assessing strategies for the deployment of underdominance drives.},

	abstract = {The mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.), which occurs widely in the subtropics and tropics, is the primary urban vector of dengue and yellow fever viruses, and an important vector of chikungunya virus. There is substantial interest in how climate change may impact the bionomics and pathogen transmission potential of this mosquito. This Forum article focuses specifically on the effects of temperature on the bionomics of Ae. aegypti, with special emphasis on the cool geographic range margins where future rising temperatures could facilitate population growth. Key aims are to: 1) broadly define intra-annual (seasonal) patterns of occurrence and abundance of Ae. aegypti, and their relation to climate conditions; 2) synthesize the existing quantitative knowledge of how temperature impacts the bionomics of different life stages of Ae. aegypti; 3) better define the temperature ranges for which existing population dynamics models for Ae. aegypti are likely to produce robust predictions; 4) explore potential impacts of climate warming on human risk for exposure to Ae. aegypti at its cool range margins; and 5) identify knowledge or data gaps that hinder our ability to predict risk of human exposure to Ae. aegypti at the cool margins of its geographic range now and in the future. We first outline basic scenarios for intra-annual occurrence and abundance patterns for Ae. aegypti, and then show that these scenarios segregate with regard to climate conditions in selected cities where they occur. We then review how near-constant and intentionally fluctuating temperatures impact development times and survival of eggs and immatures. A subset of data, generated in controlled experimental studies, from the published literature is used to plot development rates and survival of eggs, larvae, and pupae in relation to water temperature. The general shape of the relationship between water temperature and development rate is similar for eggs, larvae, and pupae. Once the lower developmental zero temperature (10–14°C) is exceeded, there is a near-linear relationship up to 30°C. Above this temperature, the development rate is relatively stable or even decreases slightly before falling dramatically near the upper developmental zero temperature, which occurs at ∼38–42°C. Based on life stage-specific linear relationships between water temperature and development rate in the 15–28°C range, the lower developmental zero temperature is estimated to be 14.0°C for eggs, 11.8°C for larvae, and 10.3°C for pupae. We further conclude that available population dynamics models for Ae. aegypti, such as CIMSiM and Skeeter Buster, likely produce robust predictions based on water temperatures in the 16–35°C range, which includes the geographic areas where Ae. aegypti and its associated pathogens present the greatest threat to human health, but that they may be less reliable in cool range margins where water temperatures regularly fall below 15°C. Finally, we identify knowledge or data gaps that hinder our ability to predict risk of human exposure to Ae. aegypti at the cool margins of its range, now and in the future, based on impacts on mosquito population dynamics of temperature and other important factors, such as water nutrient content, larval density, presence of biological competitors, and human behavior.},

	abstract = {Dengue-suppressing Wolbachia strains are promising tools for arbovirus control, particularly as they have the potential to self-spread following local introductions. To test this, we followed the frequency of the transinfected Wolbachia strain wMel through Ae. aegypti in Cairns, Australia, following releases at 3 nonisolated locations within the city in early 2013. Spatial spread was analysed graphically using interpolation and by fitting a statistical model describing the position and width of the wave. For the larger 2 of the 3 releases (covering 0.97 km2 and 0.52 km2), we observed slow but steady spatial spread, at about 100–200 m per year, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. In contrast, the smallest release (0.11 km2) produced erratic temporal and spatial dynamics, with little evidence of spread after 2 years. This is consistent with the prediction concerning fitness-decreasing Wolbachia transinfections that a minimum release area is needed to achieve stable local establishment and spread in continuous habitats. Our graphical and likelihood analyses produced broadly consistent estimates of wave speed and wave width. Spread at all sites was spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity will affect large-scale Wolbachia transformations of urban mosquito populations. The persistence and spread of Wolbachia in release areas meeting minimum area requirements indicates the promise of successful large-scale population transformation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria control has not been routinely informed by the assessment of subnational variation in malaria deaths. We combined data from the Malaria Atlas Project and the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate malaria mortality across sub-Saharan Africa on a grid of 5 km2 from 1990 through 2015.
METHODS: We estimated malaria mortality using a spatiotemporal modeling framework of geolocated data (i.e., with known latitude and longitude) on the clinical incidence of malaria, coverage of antimalarial drug treatment, case fatality rate, and population distribution according to age.
RESULTS: Across sub-Saharan Africa during the past 15 years, we estimated that there was an overall decrease of 57\% (95\% uncertainty interval, 46 to 65) in the rate of malaria deaths, from 12.5 (95\% uncertainty interval, 8.3 to 17.0) per 10,000 population in 2000 to 5.4 (95\% uncertainty interval, 3.4 to 7.9) in 2015. This led to an overall decrease of 37\% (95\% uncertainty interval, 36 to 39) in the number of malaria deaths annually, from 1,007,000 (95\% uncertainty interval, 666,000 to 1,376,000) to 631,000 (95\% uncertainty interval, 394,000 to 914,000). The share of malaria deaths among children younger than 5 years of age ranged from more than 80\% at a rate of death of more than 25 per 10,000 to less than 40\% at rates below 1 per 10,000. Areas with high malaria mortality ({\textgreater}10 per 10,000) and low coverage ({\textless}50\%) of insecticide-treated bed nets and antimalarial drugs included much of Nigeria, Angola, and Cameroon and parts of the Central African Republic, Congo, Guinea, and Equatorial Guinea.
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that there was an overall decrease of 57\% in the rate of death from malaria across sub-Saharan Africa over the past 15 years and identified several countries in which high rates of death were associated with low coverage of antimalarial treatment and prevention programs.

	abstract = {A polymorphism in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene, with a guanine to adenine nucleotide change at position -308, TNF2 is associated with increased TNF-alpha production. TNF2 homozygotes have a higher risk of severe disease and/or death due to cerebral malaria and other infectious diseases. We investigated the impact of this allele on malaria morbidity and mortality in young children who participated in an immuno-epidemiologic cohort study of malaria in an area of intense perennial Plasmodium falciparum transmission in western Kenya. A total of 1,048 children were genotyped. Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the relationship between TNF-308 variants and morbidity and mortality. The gene frequencies of the TNF1 and TNF2 alleles were 0.90 and 0.10, respectively. TNF2 homozygosity was associated with pre-term birth when compared with TNF1 homozygotes [relative risk (RR) 7.3, 95\% CI, 2.85-18.9, P = 0.002) and heterozygotes (RR 6.7, 95\% CI 2.0-23.0, P = 0.008). Among children born prematurely, the TNF2 allele was significantly associated with a higher risk of death in infancy compared with TNF1 (RR 7.47, 95\% CI 2.36-23.6). The risk of death was higher among TNF2 homozygotes than among heterozygotes. The TNF2 allele was significantly associated with high density P. falciparum parasitemia (RR 1.11, 95\% CI 1.0-1.24). Among low birth weight children, the TNF2 allele was associated with severe anemia (RR 2.16, 95\% CI 1.17-4.01) and showed a trend toward a risk for severe malaria anemia (RR 1.99, 95\% CI 0.89-4.46). These data suggest that TNF2 is a risk factor for pre-term birth and early childhood mortality and malaria morbidity in children in this region. Further understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this association is required.},

We found that IFN-gamma positive responders had higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels and significantly reduced prevalence of severe malarial anemia one month after the test compared with IFN-gamma non-responders, suggesting that IFN-gamma immune responses to these pre-erythrocytic antigens were associated with protection against malarial anemia. Children who responded by lymphocyte proliferation had a significantly longer time to first documented malaria parasitemia after birth; however, there was no correlation between the presence of lymphocyte proliferative response and higher Hb levels. We propose that IFN-gamma production could be used as a potential marker of protective immunity against malaria associated anemia in young children living in malaria holoendemic areas.},

	issn = {1756-3305},
	doi = {10.1186/1756-3305-7-380},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been speculated that widespread and sustained use of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) for over 10 years in Asembo, western Kenya, may have selected for changes in the location (indoor versus outdoor) and time (from late night to earlier in the evening) of biting of the predominant species of human malaria vectors (Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, and Anopheles arabiensis).
METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected by human landing catches over a six week period in June and July, 2011, indoors and outdoors from 17 h to 07 h, in 75 villages in Asembo, western Kenya. Collections were separated by hour of the night, and mosquitoes were identified to species and tested for sporozoite infection with Plasmodium falciparum. A subset was dissected to determine parity. Human behavior (time going to bed and rising, time spent indoors and outdoors) was quantified by cross-sectional survey. Data from past studies of a similar design and in nearby settings, but conducted before the ITN scale up commenced in the early 2000s, were compared with those from the present study.
RESULTS: Of 1,960 Anopheles mosquitoes collected in 2011, 1,267 (64.6\%) were morphologically identified as An. funestus, 663 (33.8\%) as An. gambiae sensu lato (An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis combined), and 30 (1.5\%) as other anophelines. Of the 663 An. gambiae s.l. collected, 385 were successfully tested by PCR among which 235 (61.0\%) were identified as An. gambiae s.s. while 150 (39.0\%) were identified as An. arabiensis. Compared with data collected before the scale-up of ITNs, daily entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) were consistently lower for An. gambiae s.l. (indoor EIR = 0.432 in 1985-1988, 0.458 in 1989-1990, 0.023 in 2011), and An. arabiensis specifically (indoor EIR = 0.532 in 1989-1990, 0.039 in 2009, 0.006 in 2011) but not An. funestus (indoor EIR = 0.029 in 1985-1988, 0.147 in 1989-1990, 0.010 in 2009 and 0.103 in 2011). Sporozoite rates were lowest in 2009 but rose again in 2011. Compared with data collected before the scale-up of ITNs, An. arabiensis and An. funestus were more likely to bite outdoors and/or early in the evening (p {\textless} 0.001 for all comparisons). However, when estimates of human exposure that would occur indoors (πi) or while asleep (πs) in the absence of an ITN were generated based on human behavioral patterns, the changes were modest with {\textgreater}90\% of exposure of non-ITN users to mosquito bites occurring while people were indoors in all years. The proportion of bites occurring among non-ITN users while they were asleep was ≥90\% for all species except for An. arabiensis. For this species, 97\% of bites occurred while people were asleep in 1989-1990 while in 2009 and 2011, 80\% and 84\% of bites occurred while people were asleep for those not using ITNs. Assuming ITNs prevent a theoretical maximum of 93.7\% of bites, it was estimated that 64-77\% of bites would have occurred among persons using nets while they were asleep in 1989-1990, while 20-52\% of bites would have occurred among persons using nets while they were asleep in 2009 and 2011.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence to support the contention that populations of Anopheles vectors of malaria in Asembo, western Kenya, are exhibiting departures from the well-known pattern of late night, indoor biting characteristic of these typically highly anthropophilic species. While outdoor, early evening transmission likely does occur in western Kenya, the majority of transmission still occurs indoors, late at night. Therefore, malaria control interventions such as ITNs that aim to reduce indoor biting by mosquitoes should continue to be prioritized.},

The results showed a low parasite rate (1.6\%) and correspondingly low titres of malaria antibodies in a significant proportion of the urban community, particularly in children less than 10 years old. This was associated with widespread use in the urban community of antimalarial drugs, particularly chloroquine, as prophylaxis. The parasite rate in the rural community was 22\%, and 97\% of the sample population over 1 year of age had antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum. These results demonstrate that a substantial proportion of urban children are growing up with little exposure to malaria, even in a region considered endemic for malaria.

It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases, there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of R0, whereas the other produces nonsensical results.},

	abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

Long-standing empirical evidence supporting the LW hypothesis has been overturned, while new models and data are constantly being published. Statistical methods have been criticized and new methods put forward. In parallel with the empirical studies, theoretical search models have been developed. Some theories have been disproved while others remain. Here, we gather together the current state of the art on the role of LWs in optimal foraging theory. We examine the body of theory underpinning the subject. Then we present new results showing that deviations from the idealized one-dimensional search model greatly reduce or remove the advantage of LWs. The search strategy of an LW with exponent μ = 2 is therefore not as robust as is widely thought. We also review the available techniques, and their potential pitfalls, for analysing field data. It is becoming increasingly recognized that there is a wide range of mechanisms that can lead to the apparent observation of power-law patterns. The consequence of this is that the detection of such patterns in field data implies neither that the foragers in question are performing an LW, nor that they have evolved to do so. We conclude that LWs are neither a universal optimal search strategy, nor are they as widespread in nature as was once thought.},

Population size can be estimated through mark–release–recapture (MRR) experiments that are based on the assumption that the ratio of recaptured individuals to the total captures approximates the ratio of marked individuals released to the total population. However, methods to obtain population size estimates usually consider pooled data and are often based on the total number of marked and unmarked captures. We here present a logistic regression model, based on the principle of the well-known Fisher–Ford method, specific for MRR experiments where the information available is the number of marked mosquitoes released, the number of marked and unmarked mosquitoes caught in each trap and on each day, and the geographic coordinates of the traps. The model estimates population size, taking into consideration the distance between release points and traps, the time between release and recapture, and the loss of marked mosquitoes to death or dispersal. The performance and accuracy of the logistic regression model has been assessed using simulated data from known population sizes. We then applied the model to data from MRR experiments with Aedes albopictus Skuse performed on the campus of “Sapienza” University in Rome (Italy).},

	abstract = {Population density is a key ecological variable, and it has recently been shown how captures on an array of traps over several closely-spaced time intervals may be modelled to provide estimates of population density (Borchers and Efford 2007). Specifics of the model depend on the properties of the traps (more generally ‘detectors’). We provide a concise description of the newly developed likelihood-based methods and extend them to include ‘proximity detectors’ that do not restrict the movements of animals after detection. This class of detector includes passive DNA sampling and camera traps. The probability model for spatial detection histories comprises a submodel for the distribution of home-range centres (e.g. 2-D Poisson) and a detection submodel (e.g. halfnormal function of distance between a range centre and a trap). The model may be fitted by maximising either the full likelihood or the likelihood conditional on the number of animals observed. A wide variety of other effects on detection probability may be included in the likelihood using covariates or mixture models, and differences in density between sites or between times may also be modelled. We apply the method to data on stoats Mustela erminea in a New Zealand beech forest identified by microsatellite DNA from hair samples. The method assumes that multiple individuals may be recorded at a detector on one occasion. Formal extension to ‘single-catch’ traps is difficult, but in our simulations the ‘multi-catch’ model yielded nearly unbiased estimates of density for moderate levels of trap saturation (≤ 86\% traps occupied), even when animals were clustered or the traps spanned a gradient in density.},

Decades of research have revealed that attraction to hosts is suppressed for days after blood-feeding. During this time, females coordinate complex physiological changes, allowing them to utilize blood protein to develop eggs: clearing excess fluid, digesting protein, and egg maturation. How do mechanosensation, nutrient consumption, and reproductive pathways combine to produce the full expression of host-seeking suppression? Understanding mechanisms of endogenous host-seeking suppression may allow them to be ‘weaponized’ against mosquitoes through exogenous activation and developed as tools for vector control.

	abstract = {Most species of mosquitoes must engage in host-seeking behavior to find a vertebrate host and ingest a meal of blood in order to initiate and complete each oögenic cycle. Female Aedes aegypti fed to repletion almost immediately fail to respond to odor cues that would otherwise lead them to a host for another blood meal. This response is delayed for approx. 24h in females that ingest small blood meals. In both instances, during this period of inhibition, the hemolymph titer of Ae. aegypti Head Peptide I (Aea-HP-I; pGlu-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Ser-Leu-Lys-Thr-Arg-Phe-NH2) rises to a peak, as measured with an Aea-HP-I radioimmunoassay (RIA). This homologous RIA is based on an antiserum that specifically binds Aea-HP-I (5–100 fmol range, 1:100,000 final dilution) as compared to other related peptides, Aea-HP-I and at least one other immunoreactive peptide were identified in pooled hemolymph from sugar-fed females with HPLC fractionation and the RIA. To determine whether Aea-HP-I affects host-seeking behavior, synthetic Aea-HP-I and related peptides were injected into non-oögenic females, which actively seek a host. Host-seeking behavior was inhibited by Aea-HP-I within a dosage range of 16.5–825 pmol/female, whereas related peptides differing by a few amino acids had no effect. The relatively high doses of Aea-HP-I, which elicited behavioral inhibition, were rapidly degraded in vivo as determined with the RIA of hemolymph from experimental females. Other associated behaviors were not altered by the Aea-HP-I injection, even at high doses. These results together suggest that Aea-HP-I regulates the observed behavioral inhibition in this mosquito species.},

	abstract = {Metal pollution is a growing concern that affects the health of humans and animals globally. Copper is an essential insect micronutrient required for respiration, pigmentation and oxidative stress protection but can also act as a potentially toxic trace element. While several studies have focused on the negative fitness effects of copper on the aquatic larvae of mosquitoes, the effects of larval copper exposure on adult mosquito fitness (i.e., survival and fecundity) and their ability to transmit parasites (i.e., vector competence) remains unclear. Here, using a well-studied model vector-parasite system, the mosquito Aedes aegypti and parasite Dirofilaria immitis, we show that sublethal copper exposure in larval mosquitoes alters adult female fecundity and vector competence. Specifically, mosquitoes exposed to copper had a hormetic fecundity response and mosquitoes exposed to 600 μg/L of copper had significantly fewer infective parasite larvae than control mosquitoes not exposed to copper. Thus, exposure of mosquito larvae to copper levels far below EPA-mandated safe drinking water limits (1300 μg/L) can impact vector-borne disease dynamics not only by reducing mosquito abundance (through increased larval mortality), but also by reducing parasite transmission risk. Our results also demonstrated that larval copper is retained through metamorphosis to adulthood in mosquitoes, indicating that these insects could transfer copper from aquatic to terrestrial foodwebs, especially in urban areas where they are abundant. To our knowledge this is the first study to directly link metal exposure with vector competence (i.e., ability to transmit parasites) in any vector-parasite system. Additionally, it also demonstrates unequivocally that mosquitoes can transfer contaminants from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems. These results have broad implications for public health because they directly linking contaminants and vector-borne disease dynamics, as well as linking mosquitoes and contaminant dynamics.},

When the cord was cut anterior to the second abdominal ganglion, massive hyperphagia resulted, many females ruptured, and blood intake was more than four times that of the untreated controls. As the site of the operation was moved stepwise posteriorly leaving more ganglia connected to the brain via the ventral nerve cord, the degree of hyperphagia and quantity of ingested blood was reduced. On the basis of these observations it was concluded that the termination of feeding was initiated by segmental abdominal stretch receptors which act in concert and signal the presence of optimal blood meal volume to the brain. Five additional mosquito species were tested for hyperphagia and all ingested three to four times the normal blood meal volume when the ventral nerve cord was cut. Females with the nerve cord severed showed normal ovarian development and egg formation, but oviposition was inhibited.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess the contributions of both microbial larvicides and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in terms of reducing malaria incidence in an integrated vector management programme in an area moderately endemic for malaria in the western Kenyan highlands.
Methods A pre-post, control group design was used. Larval and adult vector populations were surveyed weekly in six separate valley communities. The incidence of Plasmodium infections in children 6 months to 13 years of age was measured during the long and short rainy seasons each year. Baseline data were collected for 17 months, after which Bacillus-based larvicides were applied weekly to aquatic habitats in three of the valleys for another 19 months. At around the same time the larviciding was initiated, ITNs were introduced gradually into all study communities by the National Malaria Control Programme. The effect of larviciding, ITNs and other determinants of malaria risk was assessed by means of generalized estimating equations. Findings The risk of acquiring new parasite infections in children was substantially and independently reduced by ITN use (odds ratio, OR: 0.69; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 0.48–0.99) and larvicide application (OR: 0.44; 95\% CI: 0.23–0.82), after adjusting for confounders.
Conclusion Vector control with microbial larvicides enhanced the malaria control achieved with ITNs alone. Anti-larval measures are a promising complement to ITN distribution in the economically important highland areas and similar transmission settings in Africa.},

	abstract = {Background: Spatial modeling is increasingly utilized to elucidate relationships between demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors, and infectious disease prevalence data. However, there is a paucity of studies focusing on spatiotemporal modeling that take into account the uncertainty of diagnostic techniques.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We obtained Schistosoma japonicum prevalence data, based on a standardized indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), from annual reports from 114 schistosome-endemic villages in Dangtu County, southeastern part of the People’s Republic of China, for the period 1995 to 2004. Environmental data were extracted from satellite images. Socioeconomic data were available from village registries. We used Bayesian spatio-temporal models, accounting for the sensitivity and specificity of the IHA test via an equation derived from the law of total probability, to relate the observed with the ‘true’ prevalence. The risk of S. japonicum was positively associated with the mean land surface temperature, and negatively correlated with the mean normalized difference vegetation index and distance to the nearest water body. There was no significant association between S. japonicum and socioeconomic status of the villages surveyed. The spatial correlation structures of the observed S. japonicum seroprevalence and the estimated infection prevalence differed from one year to another. Variance estimates based on a model adjusted for the diagnostic error were larger than unadjusted models. The generated prediction map for 2005 showed that most of the former and current infections occur in close proximity to the Yangtze River.
Conclusion/Significance: Bayesian spatial-temporal modeling incorporating diagnostic uncertainty is a suitable approach for risk mapping S. japonicum prevalence data. The Yangtze River and its tributaries govern schistosomiasis transmission in Dangtu County, but spatial correlation needs to be taken into consideration when making risk prediction at small scales.},

	abstract = {Malaria vector control targeting the larval stages of mosquitoes was applied successfully against many species of Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) in malarious countries until the mid-20th Century. Since the introduction of DDT in the 1940s and the associated development of indoor residual spraying (IRS), which usually has a more powerful impact than larval control on vectorial capacity, the focus of malaria prevention programmes has shifted to the control of adult vectors. In the Afrotropical Region, where malaria is transmitted mainly by Anopheles funestus Giles and members of the Anopheles gambiae Giles complex, gaps in information on larval ecology and the ability of An. gambiae sensu lato to exploit a wide variety of larval habitats have discouraged efforts to develop and implement larval control strategies. Opportunities to complement adulticiding with other components of integrated vector management, along with concerns about insecticide resistance, environmental impacts, rising costs of IRS and logistical constraints, have stimulated renewed interest in larval control of malaria vectors. Techniques include environmental management, involving the temporary or permanent removal of anopheline larval habitats, as well as larviciding with chemical or biological agents. This present review covers large-scale trials of anopheline larval control methods, focusing on field studies in Africa conducted within the past 15 years. Although such studies are limited in number and scope, their results suggest that targeting larvae, particularly in human-made habitats, can significantly reduce malaria transmission in appropriate settings. These approaches are especially suitable for urban areas, where larval habitats are limited, particularly when applied in conjunction with IRS and other adulticidal measures, such as the use of insecticide treated bednets.},

	abstract = {Background
Malaria is an important cause of fever across much of sub-Saharan Africa and other places where Plasmodium falciparum infection is highly prevalent. Here, we estimate the fraction of fever that is attributable to malaria using data from two studies in Nagongera, Tororo, Uganda that followed cohorts of children and adults longitudinally from 2011-2019. The study included three years before and five years after indoor residual spraying (IRS) sharply reduced mosquito populations, malaria exposure, and the prevalence of malaria infection. We estimate the malaria attributable fraction of fever (MAFF) by directly quantifying and comparing fever before and after malaria control.
Methods and Findings
We estimated fever prevalence before and after IRS started, comparing subjective (i.e., self-reported) and objective fever during scheduled and unscheduled visits (i.e., to seek care) in young children (under 5 years old), older children (aged 5-10 years), and adults (over 18 years old). We estimated that there were 78-90 total days per person, per year (pppy) with subjective fever during the pre-IRS baseline in young children; 52-58 in older children; and 38-46 days in adults. After IRS, sub-clinical fever declined to 5-6 days pppy with fever in young children to around 3 in older children, and around 1 in adults: a 94\% reduction in young children, 95\% in older children, and 99\% in adults. Reductions in total fever prevalence for care seeking (during unscheduled visits) declined by around 50\% in young children, 65\% in older children, and 80\% in adults. In the before vs. after comparison, malaria accounted for 88\% of objective fever during scheduled visits in young children, 75\% in older children, and 91\% in adults. Total fever declined by 80-85\% in children and 90-93\% in adults. During care seeking, malaria accounted for around 44\% of objective fever in young children, but no meaningful differences were observed at other ages. These patterns were accompanied by changes in care seeking and total fever. Over the first few months of the study, care seeking rates increased in all groups, but then care seeking rates started a decline that continued until the study ended. By the end of the study, care seeking rates had declined by more than 75\% overall compared with the start.
Conclusions
The fraction attributed to malaria differed by age and context. In this study population with good access to care, fever was rare at the end of the study in the absence of malaria. Based on the before vs. after comparison, malaria was directly or indirectly responsible for most subjective fever in the clinical setting, and it was also the dominant cause of objective fever. Surprisingly, a large fraction of subjective fever that occurred before IRS, during both scheduled and unscheduled visits, occurred in people who tested negative for malaria. The study draws attention to the importance of sub-clinical disease as a contributor to the burden of health in malaria endemic settings.

	abstract = {Integrated vector management for malaria control has received a lot of recent interest. Attacking multiple points in the transmission cycle is hoped to act synergistically and improve upon current single-tool interventions based on the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs). In the present study, we theoretically examined the application of larval habitat source reduction with ITNs in reducing malaria transmission. We selected this type of environmental management to complement ITNs because of a potential secondary mode of action that both control strategies share. In addition to increasing vector mortality, ITNs reduce the rate at which female mosquitoes locate human hosts for blood feeding, thereby extending their gonotrophic cycle. Similarly, while reducing adult vector emergence and abundance, source reduction of larval habitats may prolong the cycle duration by extending delays in locating oviposition sites. We found, however, that source reduction of larval habitats only operates through this secondary mode of action when habitat density is below a critical threshold. Hence, we illustrate how this strategy becomes increasingly effective when larval habitats are limited. We also demonstrate that habitat source reduction is better suited to human populations of higher density and in the presence of insecticide resistance or when the insecticidal properties of ITNs are depleted.},

For accurate planning of TB control programs, this estimate and others have been revised using data from additional countries and by including in the model previously treated TB cases, which had not been accounted for in the previous analysis.
Methods. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify variables that were predictive of MDR-TB frequency among new and previously treated cases surveyed in 90 and 77 countries, respectively. These variables were then used to estimate MDR-TB frequencies in countries that had not been surveyed.
Results. The total number of MDR-TB cases estimated to have occurred worldwide in 2004 is 424,203 (95\% CI, 376,019–620,061), or 4.3\% (95\% CI, 3.8\%–6.1\%) of all new and previously treated TB cases. In the same year, 181,408 (95\% CI, 135,276–319,017) MDR-TB cases were estimated to have occurred among previously treated TB cases alone. Three countries—China, India, and the Russian Federation—accounted for 261,362 (95\% CI, 180,779–414,749) MDR-TB cases, or 62\% of the estimated global burden.
Conclusions. These updated sets of estimates incorporating previously treated TB cases call for an urgent plan to expand appropriate diagnostic and treatment services for patients with MDR-TB in low-resource settings.},

	abstract = {Background: To design an effective strategy for the control of malaria requires a map of infection and disease risks to select appropriate suites of interventions. Advances in model based geo-statistics and malaria parasite prevalence data assemblies provide unique opportunities to redefine national Plasmodium falciparum risk distributions. Here we present a new map of malaria risk for Kenya in 2009.
Methods: Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate data were assembled from cross-sectional community based surveys undertaken from 1975 to 2009. Details recorded for each survey included the month and year of the survey, sample size, positivity and the age ranges of sampled population. Data were corrected to a standard age-range of two to less than 10 years (PfPR2-10) and each survey location was geo-positioned using national and on-line digital settlement maps. Ecological and climate covariates were matched to each PfPR2-10 survey location and examined separately and in combination for relationships to PfPR2-10. Significant covariates were then included in a Bayesian geostatistical spatial-temporal framework to predict continuous and categorical maps of mean PfPR2-10 at a 1 × 1 km resolution across Kenya for the year 2009. Model hold-out data were used to test the predictive accuracy of the mapped surfaces and distributions of the posterior uncertainty were mapped.
Results: A total of 2,682 estimates of PfPR2-10 from surveys undertaken at 2,095 sites between 1975 and 2009 were selected for inclusion in the geo-statistical modeling. The covariates selected for prediction were urbanization; maximum temperature; precipitation; enhanced vegetation index; and distance to main water bodies. The final Bayesian geostatistical model had a high predictive accuracy with mean error of -0.15\% PfPR2-10; mean absolute error of 0.38\% PfPR210; and linear correlation between observed and predicted PfPR2-10 of 0.81. The majority of Kenya's 2009 population (35.2 million, 86.3\%) reside in areas where predicted PfPR2-10 is less than 5\%; conversely in 2009 only 4.3 million people (10.6\%) lived in areas where PfPR2-10 was predicted to be ≥40\% and were largely located around the shores of Lake Victoria.
Conclusion: Model based geo-statistical methods can be used to interpolate malaria risks in Kenya with precision and our model shows that the majority of Kenyans live in areas of very low P. falciparum risk. As malaria interventions go to scale effectively tracking epidemiological changes of risk demands a rigorous effort to document infection prevalence in time and space to remodel risks and redefine intervention priorities over the next 10-15 years.},

Methods. The study was conducted among adults, by use of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. A single dose of Peru-15 (∼2 ϫ 108 cfu) or placebo (buffer only) was given in standard bicarbonate and ascorbic acid buffer.
Results. Study treatment did not elicit any major adverse events in the volunteers, during either the inpatient or the outpatient phases, and there were no reports of diarrhea. V. cholerae was isolated from the stool of only 1 volunteer and was found to be genetically identical to the vaccine strain. Vibriocidal antibody responses were seen in 30 (75\%) of 40 vaccine recipients and in 3 (10\%) of 30 placebo recipients. Peripheral blood immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM antibody-secreting cell responses to lipopolysaccharide were seen in the majority of vaccine recipients (response rate, 78\%–88\%). Seroconversion for lipopolysaccharide-speciﬁc IgA antibodies was seen in 88\% of vaccine recipients. The response in vaccine recipients was signiﬁcantly higher than that in placebo recipients, in all of the immunological assays (P p .036 to !.001). A lower immunological response against cholera toxin B subunit was detected.
Conclusions. The safety and immunogenicity of this Peru-15 vaccine candidate indicates the usefulness of future studies in Bangladesh, where cholera is endemic.},

	abstract = {The distribution and seasonal transmission of malaria is affected by climate, as both vector and parasite are sensitive to temperature. A global model of malaria transmission has been developed to estimate the potential impact of climate change on seasonal transmission and populations at risk of the disease (MIASMA v.2.2). ‘‘Population at risk’’ is deﬁned as the population living in areas where climate conditions are suitable for malaria transmission. This assessment describes model simulations driven by the latest scenarios from the IPCC. The climate scenarios were derived from the Hadley Centre model HadCM3 runs with four SRES emissions scenarios: A1FI, A2, B1 and B2. The additional population at risk was determined under each of the SRES population scenarios by downscaling national estimates to the 0.5 Â 0.5  scale grid and re-aggregating by region. Additional population at risk due to climate change are projected in East Africa, central Asia, China and areas around the southern limit of the distribution in South America. Decreases in the transmission season are indicated in many areas where reductions in precipitation are projected by the Hadley Centre model, such as the Amazon and in Central America. The outcomes of the malaria model are sensitive to (1) spatial distribution of precipitation projections and (2) population growth in those areas where there is new risk due to climate change. This paper describes a new method for describing vulnerability to the potential impacts of climate change. Countries were classiﬁed according to their current vulnerability and malaria control status using expert judgement. This vulnerability incorporates both socio-economic status, as a measure for adaptive capacity, and climate as malaria at the fringes of its climate-determined distribution is easier to control than malaria in tropical endemic regions. Thus, current malaria control status is used as an indicator of adaptive capacity. For those countries that currently have a limited capacity to control the disease, the model estimates additional populations at risk by 2080s in the range of 90 m (A1FI) to 200 m (B2b). The greatest impact under B2 reﬂects population growth in risk areas in Eurasia and Africa. Climate-induced changes in the potential distribution of malaria is projected in the poor and vulnerable regions of the world. However, climate change is not likely to affect malaria transmission in the poorest countries where the climate is already highly favourable for transmission.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe heterogeneity of HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Hlabisa health district, South Africa and to correlate this with proximity of homestead to roads.
METHODS HIV prevalence measured through anonymous surveillance among pregnant women and stratiﬁed by local village clinic. Polygons were created around each clinic, assuming women attend the clinic nearest their home. A geographical information system (GIS) calculated the mean distance from homesteads in each clinic catchment to nearest primary (1Њ) and to nearest primary or secondary (2Њ) road.
RESULTS We found marked HIV heterogeneity by clinic catchment (range 19–31\% (P Ͻ 0.001). A polygon plot demonstrated lower HIV prevalence in catchments remote from 1Њ roads. Mean distance from homesteads to nearest 1Њ or 2Њ road varied by clinic catchment from 1623 to 7569 m. The mean distance from homesteads to a 1Њ or 2Њ road for each clinic catchment was strongly correlated with HIV prevalence (r ϭ 0.66; P ϭ 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS The substantial HIV heterogeneity in this district is closely correlated with proximity to a 1Њ or 2Њ road. GIS is a powerful tool to demonstrate and to start to analyse this observation. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship both at ecological and individual levels, and to develop interventions to reduce the spread of HIV infection.},

	abstract = {Background: Rainfall data have potential use for malaria prediction. However, the relationship between rainfall and the number of malaria cases is indirect and complex.
Methods: The statistical relationships between monthly malaria case count data series and monthly mean rainfall series (extracted from interpolated station data) over the period 1972 –2005 in districts in Sri Lanka was explored in four analyses: cross-correlation; cross-correlation with pre-whitening; inter-annual; and seasonal inter-annual regression.
Results: For most districts, strong positive correlations were found for malaria time series lagging zero to three months behind rainfall, and negative correlations were found for malaria time series lagging four to nine months behind rainfall. However, analysis with pre-whitening showed that most of these correlations were spurious. Only for a few districts, weak positive (at lags zero and one) or weak negative (at lags two to six) correlations were found in pre-whitened series. Inter-annual analysis showed strong negative correlations between malaria and rainfall for a group of districts in the centre-west of the country. Seasonal inter-annual analysis showed that the effect of rainfall on malaria varied according to the season and geography.
Conclusion: Seasonally varying effects of rainfall on malaria case counts may explain weak overall cross-correlations found in pre-whitened series, and should be taken into account in malaria predictive models making use of rainfall as a covariate.},

Here the development of the aquatic stages of Africa‘s principal malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles, is described at different temperatures. Development time from egg to adult was measured under laboratory conditions at constant temperatures between 10 and 40°C. Rate of development from one immature stage to the next increased at higher temperatures to a peak around 28°C and then declined. Adult development rate was greatest between 28 and 32°C, although adult emergence was highest between 22 and 26°C. No adults emerged below 18°C or above 34°C. Non-linear models were used to describe the relationship between developmental rate and temperature, which could be used for developing process-based models of malaria transmission. The utility of these ﬁndings is demonstrated by showing that a map where the climate is suitable for the development of aquatic stages of A. gambiae s.s. corresponded closely with the best map of malaria risk currently available for Africa.},

Several gridded datasets on the present population exist, but global data on future populations are largely lacking. This paper presents a dataset covering three global population forecasts for the period 1990–2100 at 0.5-degrees resolution. The basis for these forecasts is the SRES scenarios developed for the IPCC climate-modeling framework. In addition, a gridded dataset of urban and rural populations for the period 1990–2050 is presented. To illustrate how the datasets can be used, future changes in population density and urbanization were analyzed for some of the world’s major river basins. This analysis shows that the population density in the Ganges basin, which is already very high, is likely to increase considerably. The highest future increase rates were found in some African and Middle-Eastern basins. The population dataset for 2015 was compared with one previously published gridded dataset. The comparison shows some differences in population density, mainly in small, highly urbanized coastal river basins, while for large basins, the two datasets agree fairly well. We hope that the datasets here presented will prove to be a useful resource also for other researchers of global environmental change and sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Background/Aims: This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first malaria fever treatment (MFT) given to patients with general paralysis of the insane (GPI) by the Austrian psychiatrist and later Nobel laureate, Julius Wagner-Jauregg. In 1921 Wagner-Jauregg reported an impressive therapeutic success of MFT and it became the standard treatment for GPI worldwide. In this study, MFT practice in the Dutch Vincent van Gogh psychiatric hospital in GPI patients who had been admitted in the period 1924-1954 is explored. Methods: To identify patients with GPI, cause-of-death statistics was used. Data on MFT were retrieved from annual hospital reports and individual patient records. Results: Data on MFT were mentioned in the records of 43 out of 105 GPI patients. MFT was practiced in a wide range of patients with GPI, including those with disease duration of more than 1 year, up to 70 years of age, and those with a broad array of symptoms and comorbidities, such as (syphilitic) cardiac disease. Inoculation with malaria was done by patient-to-patient transmission of infected blood. Conclusions: MFT practice and mortality rates in MFT-treated patients correspond to similar findings worldwide. MFT was well tolerated and MFT-treated patients had a significantly longer survival.},

After rigorous screening, volunteers are inoculated with Plasmodium sporozoites or blood stages and monitored under strict clinical supervision until they are treated with a licensed malaria drug and the infection is completely resolved. Historically, experimental Plasmodium challenge infections were applied to confirm that Anopheles mosquitoes were the malaria vector and to treat neurosyphilis in Treponema pallidum-infected patients. The lifesaving treatment with reliable parasite inoculation, monitoring, and drug cure was awarded with a Nobel Prize in 1927 and paved the way for human trials for clinical tests of candidate drugs and vaccines. Importantly, controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies are indispensable to bridge the major gap between phase I safety and phase II field trials. Here, we describe the biological basis, historical experiences, applications, and ethical considerations for CHMI studies. Acceleration of antimalarial drug and vaccine development remains a priority in medical research and critically depends on capacity building for CHMI studies.},

To optimize power calculations for CHMI-based malaria vaccine trials, we developed a novel non-linear statistical model for parasite kinetics as measured by qPCR, using data from mosquito-based CHMI experiments in 57 individuals. We robustly account for important sources of variation between and within individuals using a Bayesian framework. Study power is most dependent on the number of individuals in each treatment arm; inter-individual variation in vaccine efficacy and the number of blood samples taken per day matter relatively little. Due to high inter-individual variation in the number of first-generation parasites, hepatic vaccine trials required significantly more study subjects than erythrocytic vaccine trials. We provide power calculations for hypothetical malaria vaccine trials of various designs and conclude that so far, power calculations have been overly optimistic. We further illustrate how upcoming techniques like needle-injected CHMI may reduce required sample sizes.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12936-015-0574-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria risk maps play an increasingly important role in disease control planning, implementation, and evaluation. The construction of these maps using modern geospatial techniques relies on covariate grids: continuous surfaces quantifying environmental factors that partially explain spatial heterogeneity in malaria endemicity. Although crucial, past variable selection processes for this purpose have often been subjective and ad-hoc, with many covariates used in modeling with little quantitative justification.
METHODS: This research consists of an extensive covariate construction and selection process for predicting Plasmodium falciparum parasite rates (PfPR) in Africa for years 2000-2012. First, a literature review was conducted to establish a comprehensive list of covariates used for malaria mapping. Second, a library of covariate data was assembled to reflect this list, a process that included the construction of multiple, temporally dynamic datasets. Third, the resulting set of covariates was leveraged to create more than 50 million possible covariate terms via factorial combinations of different spatial and temporal aggregations, transformations, and pairwise interactions. Fourth, the expanded set of covariates was reduced via successive selection criteria to yield a robust covariate subset that was assessed using an out-of-sample validation approach.
RESULTS: The final covariate subset included predominately dynamic covariates and it substantially out-performed earlier sets used by the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) for creating global malaria risk maps, with the pseudo-R(2) value for the out-of-sample validation increasing from 0.43 to 0.52. Dynamic covariates improved the model, with 17 of the 20 new covariates consisting of monthly or annual products, but the selected covariates were typically interaction terms that included both dynamic and synoptic datasets. Thus the interplay between normal (i.e., long-term averages) and immediate conditions may be key for characterizing environmental controls on parasite rate.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis represents the first effort to systematically audit covariate utility for malaria mapping and then derive an objective, empirically based set of environmental covariates for modeling PfPR. The new covariates produce more reliable representations of malaria risk patterns and how they are changing through time, and these covariates will be used to characterize spatially and temporally varying environmental conditions affecting PfPR within a geostatistical-modeling framework, thus building upon previous research by MAP that produced global malaria maps for 2007 and 2010.},

Longer and more conserved genes, which have previously been associated with severe infection in immunologically naive hosts, are rarely activated, however, implying an in vivo fitness advantage possibly through adhesion-dependent survival rates. We further show that a gene’s activation rate is positively associated sequence diversity, which could offer important new insights into the evolution and maintenance of antigenic diversity in P. falciparum malaria.},

	abstract = {In the malaria parasite P. falciparum, drug resistance generally evolves first in low-transmission settings, such as Southeast Asia and South America. Resistance takes noticeably longer to appear in the high-transmission settings of sub-Saharan Africa, although it may spread rapidly thereafter. Here, we test the hypothesis that competitive suppression of drug-resistant parasites by drug-sensitive parasites may inhibit evolution of resistance in high-transmission settings, where mixed-strain infections are common. We employ a cross-scale model, which simulates within-host (infection) dynamics and between-host (transmission) dynamics of sensitive and resistant parasites for a population of humans and mosquitoes. Using this model, we examine the effects of transmission intensity, selection pressure, fitness costs of resistance, and cross-reactivity between strains on the establishment and spread of resistant parasites. We find that resistant parasites, introduced into the population at a low frequency, are more likely to go extinct in high-transmission settings, where drug-sensitive competitors and high levels of acquired immunity reduce the absolute fitness of the resistant parasites. Under strong selection from antimalarial drug use, however, resistance spreads faster in high-transmission settings than low-transmission ones. These contrasting results highlight the distinction between establishment and spread of resistance and suggest that the former but not the latter may be inhibited in high-transmission settings. Our results suggest that within-host competition is a key factor shaping the evolution of drug resistance in P. falciparum.},

	abstract = {There is an abundance of malaria genetic data being collected from the field, yet using these data to understand the drivers of regional epidemiology remains a challenge. A key issue is the lack of models that relate parasite genetic diversity to epidemiological parameters. Classical models in population genetics characterize changes in genetic diversity in relation to demographic parameters, but fail to account for the unique features of the malaria life cycle. In contrast, epidemiological models, such as the Ross-Macdonald model, capture malaria transmission dynamics but do not consider genetics. Here, we have developed an integrated model encompassing both parasite evolution and regional epidemiology. We achieve this by combining the Ross-Macdonald model with an intra-host continuous-time Moran model, thus explicitly representing the evolution of individual parasite genomes in a traditional epidemiological framework. Implemented as a stochastic simulation, we use the model to explore relationships between measures of parasite genetic diversity and parasite prevalence, a widely-used metric of transmission intensity. First, we explore how varying parasite prevalence influences genetic diversity at equilibrium. We find that multiple genetic diversity statistics are correlated with prevalence, but the strength of the relationships depends on whether variation in prevalence is driven by host- or vector-related factors. Next, we assess the responsiveness of a variety of statistics to malaria control interventions, finding that those related to mixed infections respond quickly (∼months) whereas other statistics, such as nucleotide diversity, may take decades to respond. These findings provide insights into the opportunities and challenges associated with using genetic data to monitor malaria epidemiology.},

In contrast, adaptive geostatistical designs (AGDs) allow collection of geostatistical data over time to depend on information obtained from previous information to optimise data collection towards the analysis objective. AGDs are becoming more important in spatial mapping, particularly in poor resource settings where uniformly precise mapping may be unrealistically costly and the priority is often to identify critical areas where interventions can have the most health impact. Two constructions are: singleton and batch adaptive sampling. In singleton sampling, locations xi are chosen sequentially and at each stage, xk+1 depends on data obtained at locations x1,…,xk. In batch sampling, locations are chosen in batches of size b{\textgreater}1, allowing each new batch, \{x(k+1),…,x(k+b)\}, to depend on data obtained at locations x1,…,xkb. In most settings, batch sampling is more realistic than singleton sampling. We propose specific batch AGDs and assess their efficiency relative to their singleton adaptive and non-adaptive counterparts using simulations. We then show how we are applying these findings to inform an AGD of a rolling Malaria Indicator Survey, part of a large-scale, five-year malaria transmission reduction project in Malawi.},

We develop, fit and validate a non-spatial dynamic model driven by meteorological conditions that can capture seasonal malaria transmission dynamics at the village level in a malaria holoendemic area of north-western Burkina Faso.Methods: A total of 676 children aged 6–59 months took part in this study. Trained interviewers visited children at home weekly from December 2003 to November 2004 for Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection detection. Anopheles daily biting rate, mortality rate and growth rate were evaluated. Digital meteorological stations measured ambient temperature, humidity and rainfall in each site.Results: The overall P. falciparum malaria infection incidence was 1.1 episodes per person year. There was strong seasonal variation in P. falciparum malaria infection incidence with a peak observed in August and September, corresponding to the rainy season and a high number of mosquitoes. The model estimates of monthly mosquito abundance and the incidence of malaria infection correlated well with observed values. The fit was sensitive to daily mosquito survival and daily human parasite clearance.Conclusion: The model has demonstrated potential for local scale seasonal prediction of P. falciparum malaria infection. It could therefore be used to understand malaria transmission dynamics using meteorological parameters as the driving force and to help district health managers in identifying high-risk periods for more focused interventions.},

	abstract = {Malaria transmission is a complex system and in many parts of the world is closely related to climate conditions. However, studies on environmental determinants of malaria generally consider only concurrent climate conditions and ignore the historical or initial conditions of the system. Here, we demonstrate the concept of hysteresis in malaria transmission, defined as non-uniqueness of the relationship between malaria prevalence and concurrent climate conditions. We show the dependence of simulated malaria transmission on initial prevalence and the initial level of human immunity in the population. Using realistic time series of environmental variables, we quantify the effect of hysteresis in a modeled population. In a set of numerical experiments using HYDREMATS, a field-tested mechanistic model of malaria transmission, the simulated maximum malaria prevalence depends on both the initial prevalence and the initial level of human immunity in the population. We found the effects of initial conditions to be of comparable magnitude to the effects of interannual variability in environmental conditions in determining malaria prevalence. The memory associated with this hysteresis effect is longer in high transmission settings than in low transmission settings. Our results show that efforts to simulate and forecast malaria transmission must consider the exposure history of a location as well as the concurrent environmental drivers.},

Under future climate projections, we predicted a modest increase in the overall area suitable for malaria transmission, but a net decrease in the most suitable area. Combined with human population density projections, our maps suggest that areas with temperatures suitable for year-round, highest-risk transmission will shift from coastal West Africa to the Albertine Rift between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, whereas areas with seasonal transmission suitability will shift toward sub-Saharan coastal areas. Mapping temperature suitability places important bounds on malaria transmissibility and, along with local level demographic, socioeconomic, and ecological factors, can indicate where resources may be best spent on malaria control.},

	abstract = {The assumption that vector mortality remains constant with age is used widely to assess malaria transmission risk and predict the public health consequences of vector control strategies. However, laboratory studies commonly demonstrate clear evidence of senescence, or a decrease in physiological function and increase in vector mortality rate with age. Despite recognition of its importance, practical limitations have stifled definitive observations of mosquito senescence in the wild, where rates of extrinsic mortality are much higher than those observed under protected laboratory conditions. We developed methods to integrate available field data to understand mortality in wild Anopheles gambiae, the most import vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. We found evidence for an increase in rates of mortality with age. As expected, we also found that overall mortality is far greater in wild cohorts than commonly observed under protected laboratory conditions. The magnitude of senescence increases with An. gambiae lifespan, implying that most wild mosquitoes die long before cohorts can exhibit strong senescence. We reviewed available published mortality studies of Anopheles spp. to confirm this fundamental prediction of aging in wild populations. Senescence becomes most apparent in long-living mosquito cohorts; cohorts with low extrinsic mortality, such as protected laboratory cohorts, suffer a relatively high proportion of senescent deaths. Imprecision in estimates of vector mortality and changes in mortality with age will severely bias models of vector borne disease transmission risk, such as malaria, and the sensitivity of transmission to bias increases as the extrinsic incubation period of the parasite decreases. While we focus here on malaria, we caution that future transmission models of anti-vectorial interventions must incorporate both realistic mortality rates and age-dependent changes in mortality.},

The present study estimated the effects of temperature on duration of the gonotrophic cycle and on maturation of the ovaries of An. albimanus. Blood fed adult mosquitoes were exposed to temperatures of 24, 27, and 30°C, held individually in oviposition cages and assessed at 12 h intervals. At 24, 27, and 30°C the mean development time of the oocytes was 91.2 h (95\% C.I.: 86.5-96), 66.2 h (61.5-70.8), and 73.1 h (64-82.3), respectively. The mean duration of the gonotrophic cycle for these three temperatures was 88.4 h (81.88-94.9), 75 h (71.4-78.7), and 69.1 h (64.6-73.6) respectively. These findings indicate that both parameters in An. albimanus are reduced when temperatures rose from 24 to 30°C, in a nonlinear manner. According to these results the increase in malaria transmission during El Niño in Colombia could be associated with a shortening of the gonotrophic cycle in malaria vectors, which could enhance the frequency of man-vector contact, affecting the incidence of the disease.},

Here, we highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate 'realized' thermal reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the 'fundamental' norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing 'thermal safety margins'. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have generally been ignored in the climate change literature.},

Here we investigate the relationship between temperature, parasite development, and biting frequency in a mosquito-rodent malaria model system. We show that the pre-bloodmeal period (the time lag between mosquito emergence and first bloodmeal) increases at lower temperatures. In addition, parasite development time and feeding exhibit different thermal sensitivities such that mosquitoes might not be ready to feed at the point at which the parasite is ready to be transmitted. Exploring these effects using a simple theoretical model of human malaria shows that delays in infection and transmission can reduce the vectorial capacity of malaria mosquitoes by 20 to over 60\%, depending on temperature. These delays have important implications for disease epidemiology and control, and should be considered in future transmission models.},

Accordingly, transmission intensity is generally assumed to be higher under warmer conditions. However, development is only one component of parasite/pathogen life history and there has been little research exploring the temperature sensitivity of other traits that contribute to transmission intensity. Here, using a rodent malaria, we show that vector competence (the maximum proportion of infectious mosquitoes, which implicitly includes parasite survival across the incubation period) tails off at higher temperatures, even though parasite development rate increases. We also show that the standard measure of the parasite incubation period (i.e. time until the first mosquitoes within a cohort become infectious following an infected blood-meal) is incomplete because parasite development follows a cumulative distribution, which itself varies with temperature. Including these effects in a simple model dramatically alters estimates of transmission intensity and reduces the optimum temperature for transmission. These results highlight the need to understand the interactive effects of environmental temperature on multiple host-disease life-history traits and challenge the assumptions of many current disease models that ignore this complexity.},

Here, we present empirical evidence to show that, in addition to mean temperatures, daily fluctuations in temperature affect parasite infection, the rate of parasite development, and the essential elements of mosquito biology that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity. In general, we find that, compared with rates at equivalent constant mean temperatures, temperature fluctuation around low mean temperatures acts to speed up rate processes, whereas fluctuation around high mean temperatures acts to slow processes down. At the extremes (conditions representative of the fringes of malaria transmission, where range expansions or contractions will occur), fluctuation makes transmission possible at lower mean temperatures than currently predicted and can potentially block transmission at higher mean temperatures. If we are to optimize control efforts and develop appropriate adaptation or mitigation strategies for future climates, we need to incorporate into predictive models the effects of daily temperature variation and how that variation is altered by climate change.},

Measuring or estimating the diurnal temperature ranges to which these immatures are exposed is of the utmost importance, as these immatures will develop into adults that can transmit malaria. Recent attempts to predict the daily water temperature dynamics in mosquito breeding sites in Kenya have been successful. However, the developed model may be too complex, as the sophisticated equipment that was used for detailed meteorological observations is not widely distributed in Africa, making it difficult to predict the daily water temperature dynamics on a local scale. Therefore, we compared two energy budget models with earlier made observations of the daily water temperature dynamics in a small, shallow and clear water pool (diameter 0.96 m, depth 0.32 m) in Kenya. This paper describes (1) a complex 1-Dimensional model, and (2) a simplified second model, and (3) shows that both models mimic the water temperature dynamics in the water pool accurately. The latter model has the advantage that it only needs common weather data (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed and cloud cover) to estimate the diurnal temperature dynamics in breeding sites of African malaria mosquitoes.},

	abstract = {Background
Immature stages of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae experience high mortality, but its cause is poorly understood. Here we study the impact of rainfall, one of the abiotic factors to which the immatures are frequently exposed, on their mortality.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We show that rainfall significantly affected larval mosquitoes by flushing them out of their aquatic habitat and killing them. Outdoor experiments under natural conditions in Kenya revealed that the additional nightly loss of larvae caused by rainfall was on average 17.5\% for the youngest (L1) larvae and 4.8\% for the oldest (L4) larvae; an additional 10.5\% (increase from 0.9 to 11.4\%) of the L1 larvae and 3.3\% (from 0.1 to 3.4\%) of the L4 larvae were flushed away and larval mortality increased by 6.9\% (from 4.6 to 11.5\%) and 1.5\% (from 4.1 to 5.6\%) for L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, compared to nights without rain. On rainy nights, 1.3\% and 0.7\% of L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, were lost due to ejection from the breeding site.

Conclusions/Significance
This study demonstrates that immature populations of malaria mosquitoes suffer high losses during rainfall events. As these populations are likely to experience several rain showers during their lifespan, rainfall will have a profound effect on the productivity of mosquito breeding sites and, as a result, on the transmission of malaria. These findings are discussed in the light of malaria risk and changing rainfall patterns in response to climate change.},

Cages of mosquitoes (n ≈ 50 per cage) were placed in nine positions within the hut combining three different sides and three different heights. At each height and side, mosquitoes were offered either human blood (once every 2 d), glucose (6\% wt:vol) or a combination of the two diets over three experiments so that each cage position received one diet source. The effect of diet on survival was significant with mean survival times of 14 d for mosquitoes fed blood alone, 29 d for sugar alone and 33 d for blood plus sugar. Sugar availability decreased the odds of mortality ≈85\% compared with the blood group. Micro heterogeneities of temperature but not relative humidity also influenced survival although to a much lesser extent. The side but not height within the hut at which mosquitoes were placed, influenced survival but could not be explained by either temperature or relative humidity differences. The potential influence of seemingly minor heterogeneities of indoor microclimate upon vector longevity and vectorial capacity may merit further investigation. Also, the availability of sugar was shown to be a potentially crucial determinant of vectorial capacity. Compared with blood alone, the availability of sugar served to increase survival potential of vectors beyond ages at which they are old enough to transmit malaria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing incidences of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors are threatening the sustainable use of contemporary chemical vector control measures. Fungal entomopathogens provide a possible additional tool for the control of insecticide-resistant malaria mosquitoes. This study investigated the compatibility of the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin and two mosquito-pathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, against a laboratory colony and field population of West African insecticide-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.s. mosquitoes.
METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: A range of fungus-insecticide combinations was used to test effects of timing and sequence of exposure. Both the laboratory-reared and field-collected mosquitoes were highly resistant to permethrin but susceptible to B. bassiana and M. anisopliae infection, inducing 100\% mortality within nine days. Combinations of insecticide and fungus showed synergistic effects on mosquito survival. Fungal infection increased permethrin-induced mortality rates in wild An. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes and reciprocally, exposure to permethrin increased subsequent fungal-induced mortality rates in both colonies. Simultaneous co-exposure induced the highest mortality; up to 70.3+/-2\% for a combined Beauveria and permethrin exposure within a time range of one gonotrophic cycle (4 days).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Combining fungi and permethrin induced a higher impact on mosquito survival than the use of these control agents alone. The observed synergism in efficacy shows the potential for integrated fungus-insecticide control measures to dramatically reduce malaria transmission and enable control at more moderate levels of coverage even in areas where insecticide resistance has rendered pyrethroids essentially ineffective.},

Despite the important implications for disease transmission and malaria control, a quantitative mapping of how parasite diversity entering a mosquito relates to diversity of the parasite exiting, has not been undertaken. To examine the role that vector biology plays in modulating parasite diversity, we develop a two-part model framework that estimates the diversity as a consequence of different bottlenecks and expansion events occurring during the vector-stage of the parasite life cycle. For the underlying framework, we develop the first stochastic model of within-vector P. falciparum parasite dynamics and go on to simulate the dynamics of two parasite subpopulations, emulating multiply infected mosquitoes. We show that incorporating stochasticity is essential to capture the extensive variation in parasite dynamics, particularly in the presence of multiple parasites. In particular, unlike deterministic models, which always predict the most fit parasites to produce the most sporozoites, we find that occasionally only parasites with lower fitness survive to the sporozoite stage. This has important implications for onward transmission. The second part of our framework includes a model of sequence diversity generation resulting from recombination and reassortment between parasites within a mosquito. Our two-part model framework shows that bottlenecks entering the oocyst stage decrease parasite diversity from what is present in the initial gametocyte population in a mosquito's blood meal. However, diversity increases with the possibility for recombination and proliferation in the formation of sporozoites. Furthermore, when we begin with two parasite subpopulations in the initial gametocyte population, the probability of transmitting more than two unique parasites from mosquito to human is over 50\% for a wide range of initial gametocyte densities.},

The United States Environmental Protection  Agency (USEPA) identified 24 PFASs of interest for further study and possible  regulation. We examined 371 peer-reviewed studies published since 2001 to  understand the occurrence and distribution of 24 priority PFASs in global surface  waters and groundwater. We identified 77,541 and 16,246 data points for surface  waters and groundwater, respectively, with total PFAS concentrations ranging from  low pg/L to low mg/L levels. Most data were from Asia, Europe, and North America  with some reports from Oceania. PFAS information from other geographic regions is  lacking. PFASs levels are consistently higher in rivers and streams followed by  lakes and reservoirs and then coastal and marine systems. When sufficient data  were available, probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) were  performed from environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) to identify potential  exceedances of available guideline values for each compound by matrix, region,  and aquatic system. Specifically, exceedances of USEPA drinking water lifetime  health advisory levels were up to 74\% for PFOS in groundwater from Oceania and  69\% for PFOA in North American groundwater. Our findings support selection of  environmentally relevant experimental treatment levels for future toxicology,  ecotoxicology and bioaccumulation studies, and potable source water exposure  investigations, while highlighting PFASs and major geographic locations requiring  additional study and inclusion in global monitoring and surveillance campaigns.},

	abstract = {The impacts and limitations of personal protection measures against exposure to vectors of malaria and other mosquito-borne pathogens depend on behavioural  interactions between humans and mosquitoes. Therefore, understanding where and  when they overlap in time and space is critical. Commonly used approaches for  calculating behaviour-adjusted estimates of human exposure distribution  deliberately use soft classification of where and when people spend their time,  to yield nuanced and representative distributions of mean exposure to mosquito  bites across entire human populations or population groups. However, these  weighted averages rely on aggregating individual-level data to obtain mean human  population distributions across the relevant behavioural classes for each time  increment, so they cannot be used to test for variation between individuals.  Also, these summary outcomes are quite complex functions of the disaggregated  data, so they do not match the standard binomial or count distributions to which  routine off-the-shelf statistical tools may be confidently applied. Fortunately,  the proportions of exposure to mosquito bites that occur while indoors or asleep  can also be estimated in a simple binomial fashion, based on hard classification  of human location over a given time increment, as being either completely indoors  or completely outdoors. This simplified binomial approach allows convenient  analysis with standard off-the-shelf logistic regression tools, to statistically  assess variations between individual humans, human population subsets or vector  species. Such simplified binomial estimates of behavioural interactions between  humans and mosquitoes should be more widely used for estimating confidence  intervals around means of these indicators, comparing different vector  populations and human population groups, and assessing the influence of  individual behaviour on exposure patterns and infection risk. Also, standard  sample size estimation techniques may be readily used to estimate necessary  minimum experimental scales and data collection targets for field studies  recording these indicators as key outcomes. Sample size calculations for field  studies should allow for natural geographic variation and seasonality, taking  advantage of rolling cross-sectional designs to survey and re-survey large  numbers of separate study locations in a logistically feasible manner.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residents of malaria-endemic communities spend several hours outdoors performing different activities, e.g. cooking, story-telling or eating, thereby  exposing themselves to potentially-infectious mosquitoes. This compromises  effectiveness of indoor interventions, notably long-lasting insecticide-treated  nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). This study characterized common  peri-domestic spaces in rural south-eastern Tanzania, and assessed protective  efficacy against mosquitoes of hessian fabric mats and ribbons treated with the  spatial repellent, transfluthrin, and fitted to chairs and outdoor kitchens,  respectively. METHODS: Two hundred households were surveyed, and their most-used  peri-domestic spaces physically characterized. Protective efficacies of  locally-made transfluthrin-emanating chairs and hessian ribbons were tested in  outdoor environments of 28 households in dry and wet seasons, using  volunteer-occupied exposure-free double net traps. CDC light traps were used to  estimate host-seeking mosquito densities within open-structure outdoor kitchens.  Field-collected Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus mosquitoes were  exposed underneath the chairs to estimate 24 h-mortality. Finally, The World  Health Organization insecticide susceptibility tests were conducted on  wild-caught Anopheles from the villages. RESULTS: Approximately half (52\%) of  houses had verandas. Aside from these verandas, most houses also had  peri-domestic spaces where residents stayed most times (67\% of houses with  verandas and 94\% of non-veranda houses). Two-thirds of these spaces were sited  under trees, and only one third (34.4\%) were built-up. The outdoor structures  were usually makeshift kitchens having roofs and partial walls.  Transfluthrin-treated chairs reduced outdoor-biting An. arabiensis densities by  70-85\%, while transfluthrin-treated hessian ribbons fitted to the outdoor  kitchens caused 77-81\% reduction in the general peri-domestic area. Almost all  the field-collected An. arabiensis (99.4\%) and An. funestus (100\%) exposed under  transfluthrin-treated chairs died. The An. arabiensis were susceptible to  non-pyrethroids (pirimiphos methyl and bendiocarb), but resistant to pyrethroids  commonly used on LLINs (deltamethrin and permethrin). CONCLUSION: Most houses had  actively-used peri-domestic outdoor spaces where exposure to mosquitoes occurred.  The transfluthrin-treated chairs and ribbons reduced outdoor-biting malaria  vectors in these peri-domestic spaces, and also elicited significant mortality  among pyrethroid-resistant field-caught malaria vectors. These two new prototype  formats for transfluthrin emanators, if developed further, may constitute new  options for complementing LLINs and IRS with outdoor protection against malaria  and other mosquito-borne pathogens in areas where peri-domestic human activities  are common.},

However, the  practical difficulty of sample acquisition from wild animals tends to limit the  feasibility and effectiveness of such surveys. Xenosurveillance, using  blood-feeding invertebrates to obtain tissue samples from wild animals and then  detect their pathogens, is a promising method to do so. Here, we describe the use  of tsetse fly blood meals to determine (directly through molecular diagnostic and  indirectly through serology), the diversity of circulating blood-borne pathogens  (including bacteria, viruses and protozoa) in a natural mammalian community of  Tanzania. Molecular analyses of captured tsetse flies (182 pools of flies  totalizing 1728 flies) revealed that the blood meals obtained came from 18  different vertebrate species including 16 non-human mammals, representing  approximately 25\% of the large mammal species present in the study area.  Molecular diagnostic demonstrated the presence of different protozoa parasites  and bacteria of medical and/or veterinary interest. None of the six virus species  searched for by molecular methods were detected but an ELISA test detected  antibodies against African swine fever virus among warthogs, indicating that the  virus had been circulating in the area. Sampling of blood-feeding insects  represents an efficient and practical approach to tracking a diversity of  pathogens from multiple mammalian species, directly through molecular diagnostic  or indirectly through serology, which could readily expand and enhance our  understanding of the ecology and evolution of infectious agents and their  interactions with their hosts in wild animal communities.},

This study  engaged members of a rural Tanzanian community in developing and evaluating  simple, affordable and scalable procedures for installing readily available  screening materials on eave gaps and windows of their own houses, and then  treating those screens with a widely used IRS formulation of the organophosphate  insecticide pirimiphos-methyl (PM). METHODS: A cohort of 54 households recruited  upon consent, following which the structural features and occupant demographics  of their houses were surveyed. Indoor mosquito densities were surveyed  longitudinally, for approximately 3 months before and over 5 months after  participatory house modification and screening using locally available materials.  Each house was randomly assigned to one of three study arms: (1) No screens  installed until the end of the study (negative control), (2) untreated screens  installed, and (3) screened installed and then treated with PM, the insecticidal  activity of which was subsequently assessed using standard cone assays. RESULTS:  Almost all (52) recruited households participated until the end, at which point  all houses had been successfully screened. In most cases, screening was only  installed after making enabling structural modifications that were accepted by  the enrolled households. Compared to unscreened houses, houses with either  treated or untreated screens both almost entirely excluded Anopheles arabiensis  (Relative reduction (RR) ≥ 98\%, P {\textless} {\textless} 0.0001), the most abundant local malaria  vector. However, screens were far less effective against Culex quinquefasciatus  (RR ≤ 46\%, P {\textless} {\textless} 0.0001), a non-malaria vector causing considerable biting  nuisance, regardless of their treatment status. While PM did not augment  household level protection by screens against either mosquito species (P = 0.676  and 0.831, respectively), 8 months after treatment it still caused 73\% and 89\%  mortality among susceptible insectary-reared Anopheles gambiae following  exposures of 3 and 30 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Participatory approaches to  mosquito proofing houses may be acceptable and effective, and installed screens  may be suitable targets for residual insecticide treatments.},

In all sections, the inner mud hut walls and roofs were lined with black cotton  cloth. In one-half of the sections, the cloth was dusted with pyriproxyfen.

However, such information is limited to a few compounds (e.g., perfluorooctane  sulfonate), primarily based on rodent experiments, and the underlying  toxicological mechanism(s) for many PFAS in the environment remain poorly  understood. In the present study, we investigated 8:8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic  acid (8:8 PFPiA), an under-studied PFAS with high persistency in the environment  and biota, using the zebrafish model. We exposed zebrafish embryos ({\textless}4 hpf) to  various concentrations of 8:8 PFPiA (0, 0.0116, 0.112, 0.343, 1.34, 5.79 μM) for  144 h. Although there was no significant change in survival, hatchability and  malformations, zebrafish locomotor speed at 120 h significantly decreased in dark  photoperiod. At 144 h, several genes related to thyroid hormones that are  essential for neurodevelopment, including corticotropin releasing hormone b  (crhb), iodothyronine deiodinase 3a (dio3a), thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor  (tshr) and nkx2 homeobox1 (nkx 2.1), were up-regulated by 8:8 PFPiA at 5.79 μM.  8:8 PFPiA also significantly down-regulated a neurodevelopmental gene, elav like  neuron-specific RNA binding protein (elavl3), at 1.34 and 5.79 μM; in addition,  one oxidative stress gene was slightly but significantly up-regulated. Further,  global DNA methylation was significantly decreased at higher treatment levels,  identifying effects of 8:8 PFPiA on epigenetic regulation. However, promoter DNA  methylation of selected genes (dio3, tshr, nkx2.1) were not statistically  altered, though dio3 methylation showed a decreasing trend with 8:8 PFPiA  exposure. Our results specifically advance an understanding of molecular  toxicology of PFPiA and more broadly present an approach to define diverse  responses during animal alternative assessments of PFASs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual sprays (IRS) have decimated malaria transmission by killing indoor-feeding mosquitoes.  However, complete elimination of malaria transmission with these proven methods  is confounded by vectors that evade pesticide contact by feeding outdoors.  METHODS: For any assumed level of indoor coverage and personal protective  efficacy with insecticidal products, process-explicit malaria transmission models  suggest that insecticides that repel mosquitoes will achieve less impact upon  transmission than those that kill them outright. Here such models are extended to  explore how outdoor use of products containing either contact toxins or spatial  repellents might augment or attenuate impact of high indoor coverage of LLINs  relying primarily upon contact toxicity. RESULTS: LLIN impact could be  dramatically enhanced by high coverage with spatial repellents conferring  near-complete personal protection, but only if combined indoor use of both  measures can be avoided where vectors persist that prefer feeding indoors upon  humans. While very high levels of coverage and efficacy will be required for  spatial repellents to substantially augment the impact of LLINs or IRS, these  ambitious targets may well be at least as practically achievable as the lower  requirements for equivalent impact using contact insecticides. CONCLUSIONS:  Vapour-phase repellents may be more acceptable, practical and effective than  contact insecticides for preventing outdoor malaria transmission because they  need not be applied to skin or clothing and may protect multiple occupants of  spaces outside of treatable structures such as nets or houses.},

However, these metrics showed strong explanatory power to predict  mosquito larval abundances after stratification by water body type, with a clear  seasonal trend for each, defined on the basis of its geomorphological setting and  origin. CONCLUSION: Hydrological and geomorphological processes governing the  availability and productivity of Anopheles breeding habitat need to be understood  at the local scale for which larval source management is implemented in order to  effectively target larval source interventions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most potent malaria vectors rely heavily upon human blood so they are vulnerable to attack with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual  spraying (IRS) within houses. Mosquito taxa that can avoid feeding or resting  indoors, or by obtaining blood from animals, mediate a growing proportion of the  dwindling transmission that persists as ITNs and IRS are scaled up. PRESENTATION  OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Increasing frequency of behavioural evasion traits within  persisting residual vector systems usually reflect the successful suppression of  the most potent and vulnerable vector taxa by IRS or ITNs, rather than their  failure. Many of the commonly observed changes in mosquito behavioural patterns  following intervention scale-up may well be explained by modified taxonomic  composition and expression of phenotypically plastic behavioural preferences,  rather than altered innate preferences of individuals or populations. TESTING THE  HYPOTHESIS: Detailed review of the contemporary evidence base does not yet  provide any clear-cut example of true behavioural resistance and is, therefore,  consistent with the hypothesis presented. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Caution  should be exercised before over-interpreting most existing reports of increased  frequency of behavioural traits which enable mosquitoes to evade fatal contact  with insecticides: this may simply be the result of suppressing the most  behaviourally vulnerable of the vector taxa that constituted the original  transmission system. Mosquito taxa which have always exhibited such evasive  traits may be more accurately described as behaviourally resilient, rather than  resistant. Ongoing national or regional entomological monitoring surveys of  physiological susceptibility to insecticides should be supplemented with  biologically and epidemiologically meaningfully estimates of malaria vector  population dynamics and the behavioural phenotypes that determine intervention  impact, in order to design, select, evaluate and optimize the implementation of  vector control measures.},

Protein biomarkers  were validated by semi quantitative Western blot analysis. Nineteen and nine age  dependent protein spots were identified for A. stephensi and A. gambiae,  respectively. Among the proteins down-regulated with age were homologs of  ADF/Cofilin, cytochome c1, heat shock protein-70 and eukaryotic translation  initiation factor 5A (eIF5a). Proteins up-regulated with age included probable  methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, voltage-dependent anion-selective  channel and fructose bisphosphate aldolase. Semi quantitative Western blot  analysis confirmed expression patterns observed by 2-D DIGE for eIF5a and  ADF/Cofilin. Further work is recommended to determine whether these biomarkers  are robust to infection, blood feeding and insecticide resistance. Robust  biomarkers could then be incorporated into rapid diagnostic assays for ecological  and epidemiological studies. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we have  identified several proteins with characteristic changes in abundance in both A.  gambiae and A. stephensi during their aging process. These changes may highlight  underlying mechanisms beneath the relationship between mosquito age and factors  affecting Plasmodium transmission and mosquito control. The similarity of changes  in protein abundance between these species and the primary dengue vector Aedes  aegypti, has revealed conserved patterns of aging-specific protein regulation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disease transmitting mosquitoes locate humans and other blood hosts by identifying their characteristic odor profiles. Using their olfactory organs,  the mosquitoes detect compounds present in human breath, sweat and skins, and use  these as cues to locate and obtain blood from the humans. These odor compounds  can be synthesized in vitro, then formulated to mimic humans. While some  synthetic mosquito lures already exist, evidence supporting their utility is  limited to laboratory settings, where long-range stimuli cannot be investigated.  METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the development and field  evaluation of an odor blend consisting of known mosquito attractants namely  carbon dioxide, ammonia and carboxylic acids, which was optimized at distances  comparable with attractive ranges of humans to mosquitoes. Binary choice assays  were conducted inside a large-cage semi-field enclosure using attractant-baited  traps placed 20 m apart. This enabled high-throughput optimization of  concentrations at which the individual candidate attractants needed to be added  so as to obtain a blend maximally attractive to laboratory-reared An. gambiae. To  determine whether wild mosquitoes would also be attracted to this synthetic odor  blend and to compare it with whole humans under epidemiologically relevant  conditions, field experiments were conducted inside experimental huts, where the  blend was compared with 10 different adult male volunteers (20-34 years old). The  blend attracted 3 to 5 times more mosquitoes than humans when the two baits were  in different experimental huts (10-100 metres apart), but was equally or less  attractive than humans when compared side by side within same huts. CONCLUSION  AND SIGNIFICANCE: This highly attractive substitute for human baits might enable  development of technologies for trapping mosquitoes in numbers sufficient to  prevent rather than merely monitor transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria control methods targeting indoor-biting mosquitoes have limited impact on vectors that feed and rest outdoors. Exploiting mosquito  olfactory behaviour to reduce blood-feeding outdoors might be a sustainable  approach to complement existing control strategies. Methodologies that can  objectively quantify responses to odour under realistic field conditions and  allow high-throughput screening of many compounds are required for development of  effective odour-based control strategies. METHODS: The olfactory responses of  laboratory-reared Anopheles gambiae in a semi-field tunnel and A. arabiensis  females in an outdoor field setting to three stimuli, namely whole human odour, a  synthetic blend of carboxylic acids plus carbon dioxide and CO(2) alone at four  distances up to 100 metres were measured in two experiments using three-chambered  taxis boxes that allow mosquito responses to natural or experimentally-introduced  odour cues to be quantified. RESULTS: Taxis box assays could detect both  activation of flight and directional mosquito movement. Significantly more  (6-18\%) A. arabiensis mosquitoes were attracted to natural human odour in the  field up to 30 metres compared to controls, and blended synthetic human odours  attracted 20\% more A. gambiae in the semi-field tunnel up to 70 metres. Whereas  CO(2) elicited no response in A. arabiensis in the open field, it was attractive  to A. gambiae up to 50 metres (65\% attraction compared to 36\% in controls).  CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a simple reproducible system to allow for the  comparison of compounds that are active over medium- to long-ranges in semi-field  or full-field environments. Knowing the natural range of attraction of anopheline  mosquitoes to potential blood sources has substantial implications for the design  of malaria control strategies, and adds to the understanding of olfactory  behaviour in mosquitoes. This experimental strategy could also be extended from  malaria vectors to other motile arthropods of medical, veterinary and  agricultural significance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mosquito feeding behaviour plays a major role in determining malaria transmission intensity and the impact of specific prevention measures. Human  Landing Catch (HLC) is currently the only method that can directly and  consistently measure the biting rates of anthropophagic mosquitoes, both indoors  and outdoors. However, this method exposes the participant to mosquito-borne  pathogens, therefore new exposure-free methods are needed to replace it. METHODS:  Commercially available electrocuting grids (EGs) were evaluated as an alternative  to HLC using a Latin Square experimental design in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Both  HLC and EGs were used to estimate the proportion of human exposure to mosquitoes  occurring indoors (πi), as well as its two underlying parameters: the proportion  of mosquitoes caught indoors (Pi) and the proportion of mosquitoes caught between  the first and last hour when most people are indoors (Pfl). RESULTS: HLC and EGs  methods accounted for 69\% and 31\% of the total number of female mosquitoes caught  respectively and both methods caught more mosquitoes outdoors than indoors.  Results from the gold standard HLC suggest that An. gambiae s.s. in Dar es Salaam  is neither exophagic nor endophagic (Pi ≈ 0.5), whereas An. arabiensis is  exophagic (Pi {\textless} {\textless} 0.5). Both species prefer to feed after 10 pm when most people  are indoors (Pfl {\textgreater} {\textgreater}0.5). EGs yielded estimates of Pi for An. gambiae s.s., An.  arabiensis and An. coustani, that were approximately equivalent to those with HLC  but significantly underestimated Pfl for An. gambiae s.s. and An. coustani. The  relative sampling sensitivity of EGs declined over the course of the night (p ≤  0.001) for all mosquito taxa except An. arabiensis. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial EGs  sample human-seeking mosquitoes with high sensitivity both indoors and outdoors  and accurately measure the propensity of Anopheles malaria vectors to bite  indoors rather than outdoors. However, further modifications are needed to  stabilize sampling sensitivity over a full nocturnal cycle so that they can be  used to survey patterns of human exposure to mosquitoes.},

METHODS: A process-explicit  simulation of malaria transmission was applied to results of 4 recent Phase II  experimental hut trials comparing a new mosaic long-lasting insecticidal net  (LLIN) which combines deltamethrin and piperonyl butoxide with another LLIN  product by the same manufacturer relying on deltamethrin alone. RESULTS: Direct  estimates of mean personal protection against insecticide-resistant vectors in  Vietnam, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Benin revealed no clear advantage for  combination LLINs over deltamethrin-only LLINs (P = 0.973) unless both types of  nets were extensively washed (Relative mean entomologic inoculation rate (EIR) ±  standard error of the mean (SEM) for users of combination nets compared to users  of deltamethrin only nets = 0.853 ± 0.056, P = 0.008). However, simulations of  impact at high coverage (80\% use) predicted consistently better impact for the  combination net across all four sites (Relative mean EIR ± SEM in communities  with combination nets, compared with those using deltamethrin only nets = 0.613 ±  0.076, P {\textless} 0.001), regardless of whether the nets were washed or not (P = 0.467).  Nevertheless, the degree of advantage obtained with the combination varied  substantially between sites and their associated resistant vector populations.  CONCLUSION: Process-explicit simulations of community-level protection,  parameterized using locally-relevant experimental hut studies, should be  explicitly considered when choosing vector control products for large-scale  epidemiological trials or public health programme procurement, particularly as  growing insecticide resistance necessitates the use of multiple active  ingredients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sampling malaria vectors and measuring their biting density is of paramount importance for entomological surveys of malaria transmission. Human  landing catch (HLC) has been traditionally regarded as a gold standard method for  surveying human exposure to mosquito bites. However, due to the risk of human  participant exposure to mosquito-borne parasites and viruses, a variety of  alternative, exposure-free trapping methods were compared in lowland, south-east  Zambia. METHODS: Centres for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light trap  (CDC-LT), Ifakara Tent Trap model C (ITT-C), resting boxes (RB) and window exit  traps (WET) were all compared with HLC using a 3 × 3 Latin Squares design  replicated in 4 blocks of 3 houses with long lasting insecticidal nets, half of  which were also sprayed with a residual deltamethrin formulation, which was  repeated for 10 rounds of 3 nights of rotation each during both the dry and wet  seasons. RESULTS: The mean catches of HLC indoor, HLC outdoor, CDC-LT, ITT-C,  WET, RB indoor and RB outdoor, were 1.687, 1.004, 3.267, 0.088, 0.004, 0.000 and  0.008 for Anopheles quadriannulatus Theobald respectively, and 7.287, 6.784,  10.958, 5.875, 0.296, 0.158 and 0.458, for An. funestus Giles, respectively.  Indoor CDC-LT was more efficient in sampling An. quadriannulatus and An. funestus  than HLC indoor (Relative rate [95\% Confidence Interval] = 1.873 [1.653, 2.122]  and 1.532 [1.441, 1.628], respectively, P {\textless} 0.001 for both). ITT-C was the only  other alternative which had comparable sensitivity (RR = 0.821 [0.765, 0.881], P  {\textless} 0.001), relative to HLC indoor other than CDC-LT for sampling An. funestus.  CONCLUSIONS: While the two most sensitive exposure-free techniques primarily  capture host-seeking mosquitoes, both have substantial disadvantages for routine  community-based surveillance applications: the CDC-LT requires regular recharging  of batteries while the bulkiness of ITT-C makes it difficult to move between  sampling locations. RB placed indoors or outdoors and WET had consistently poor  sensitivity so it may be useful to evaluate additional alternative methods, such  as pyrethrum spray catches and back packer aspirators, for catching resting  mosquitoes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gold-standard tests of mosquito repellents involve exposing human volunteers to host-seeking mosquitoes, to assess the protective efficacy of the  repellents. These techniques are not exposure-free and cannot be performed prior  to toxicological evaluation. It is postulated that synthetic lures could provide  a useful assay that mimics in-vivo conditions for use in high-throughput  screening for mosquito repellents. METHODS: This paper reports on a semi-field  evaluation of repellents using a synthetic blend of human derived attractants for  the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto Different concentrations of  known repellents, N, N diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (deet) and Para-methane-3, 8,  diol (PMD) were added into traps baited with the synthetic blend, and resulting  changes in mosquito catches were measured. RESULTS: All test concentrations of  deet (0.001\% to 100\%) reduced the attractiveness of the synthetic blend. However,  PMD was repellent only at 0.25\%. Above this concentration, it significantly  increased the attractiveness of the blend. There was no relationship between the  repellent concentrations and the change in mosquito catches when either deet (r2  = 0.033, P = 0.302) or PMD (r2 = 0.020, P = 0.578) was used. CONCLUSION: It is  concluded that while some repellents may reduce the attractiveness of synthetic  human odours, others may instead increase their attractiveness. Such  inconsistencies indicate that even though the synthetic attractants may provide  exposure-free and consistent test media for repellents, careful selection and  multiple-repellent tests are necessary to ascertain their suitability for use in  repellent screening. The synthetic odour blend tested here is not yet  sufficiently refined to serve as replacement for humans in repellent testing, but  may be developed further and evaluated in different formats for exposure free  repellent testing purposes.},

	abstract = {Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) infections almost always caused overt symptoms, so effective case and contact management enabled  its effective eradication within months. However, Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes only mild symptoms, so  transmission chains may grow to include several individuals before at least one  index case becomes ill enough to self-report for diagnosis and care. Here, simple  mathematical models were developed to evaluate the implications of delayed index  case detection for retrospective contact tracing and management responses.  Specifically, these simulations illustrate how: (1) Contact tracing and  management may effectively contain most but not all large SARS-CoV-2 clusters  arising at foci with high reproduction numbers because rapidly expanding  transmission chains ensure at least one overtly symptomatic index case occurs  within two viral generations a week or less apart. (2) However, lower  reproduction numbers give rise to thinner transmission chains extending through  longer sequences of non-reporting asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals,  often spanning three or more viral generations (≥2 weeks of transmission) before  an overtly symptomatic index case occurs. (3) Consequently, it is not always  possible to fully trace and contain such long, thin transmission chains, so the  community transmission they give rise to is underrepresented in surveillance  data. (4) Wherever surveillance systems are weak and/or transmission proceeds  within population groups with lower rates of overt clinical symptoms and/or  self-reporting, case and contact management effectiveness may be more severely  limited, even at the higher reproduction numbers associated with larger  outbreaks. (5) Because passive surveillance platforms may be especially slow to  detect the thinner transmission chains that occur at low reproduction numbers,  establishing satisfactory confidence of elimination may require that no confirmed  cases are detected for two full months, throughout which presumptive preventative  measures must be maintained to ensure complete collapse of undetected residual  transmission. (6) Greater scope exists for overcoming these limitations by  enhancing field surveillance for new suspected cases than by improving diagnostic  test sensitivity. (7) While population-wide active surveillance may enable  complete traceability and containment, this goal may also be achievable through  enhanced passive surveillance for paucisymptomatic infections, combining readily  accessible decentralized testing with population hypersensitization to  self-reporting with mild symptoms. Containment and elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will  rely far more upon presumptive, population-wide prevention measures than was  necessary for SARS-CoV-1, necessitating greater ambition, political will,  investment, public support, persistence and patience. Nevertheless, case and  contact management may be invaluable for at least partially containing SARS-CoV-2  transmission, especially larger outbreaks, but only if enabled by sufficiently  sensitive surveillance. Furthermore, consistently complete transmission chain  containment may be enabled by focally enhanced surveillance around manageably  small numbers of outbreaks in the end stages of successful elimination campaigns,  so that their endpoints may be accelerated and sustained.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of malaria prevention with long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying is limited by emerging insecticide  resistance, evasive mosquito behaviours that include outdoor biting, sub-optimal  implementation and inappropriate use. New vector control interventions are  required and their potential effectiveness will be enhanced if existing household  perceptions and practices are integrated into intervention design. METHODS: This  qualitative descriptive study used focus groups discussions, in-depth interviews  and photovoice methods to explore mosquito control perceptions and practices  among residents in four study sites in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. RESULTS:  Mosquitoes were perceived as a growing problem, directly attributed to widespread  environmental deterioration and lack of effective mosquito control interventions.  Malaria and nuisance biting were perceived as the main problem caused by  mosquitoes. Breeding sites were clearly distinguished from resting sites but  residents did not differentiate between habitats producing malaria vector  mosquitoes and others producing mostly nuisance mosquitoes. The most frequently  mentioned protection methods in the wealthiest locations were bed nets, aerosol  insecticide sprays, window screens, and fumigation, while bed nets were most  frequently mentioned and described as 'part of the culture' in the least wealthy  locations. Mosquito-proofed housing was consistently viewed as desirable, but  considered unaffordable outside wealthiest locations. Slapping and covering up  with clothing were most commonly used to prevent biting outdoors. Despite their  utility outdoors, topical repellents applied to the skin were considered  expensive, and viewed with suspicion due to perceived side effects. Improving the  local environment was the preferred method for preventing outdoor biting.  Affordability, effectiveness, availability, practicality, as well as social  influences, such as government recommendations, socialization and internalization  (familiarization and habit) were described as key factors influencing uptake.  CONCLUSIONS: Outdoor transmission is widely accepted as an obstacle to malaria  elimination. Larval source management, targeting both malaria vectors and  nuisance-biting mosquitoes, is the preferred method for mosquito control among  the residents of Dar es Salaam and should be prioritized for development  alongside new methods for outdoor personal protection. Even if made available,  effective and affordable, these additional interventions may require time and  user experience to achieve positive reputations and trustworthiness.},

Here we report a preliminary evaluation of  an effective, user-friendly prototype product for delivering spatial repellents  to protect against malaria vector mosquitoes. FINDINGS: Protective efficacy of a  4.0 × 0.3 m strip of hessian sacking treated with 10 ml of transfluthrin was  evaluated in a 60 m × 2 m × 2.5 m netting tunnel with malaria-free  insectary-reared Anopheles arabiensis Patton mosquitoes. Personal protection, in  terms of proportional reduction of exposure to bites, was measured by comparing  human landing catches of volunteers with treated and untreated strips. A freshly  treated hessian strip reduced mosquito attack rate on human volunteers by {\textgreater} 99\%  and consistently conferred {\textgreater} 90\% protective efficacy for a period of 6 months.  Over the entire study period, only 22 out of 1400 released mosquitoes bit  volunteers using the treated sacking strip while 894 out of 1400 mosquitoes  released into cages containing volunteers using an untreated strip fed upon them.  CONCLUSION: Locally available natural fibers may be promising absorbent  substrates for delivering spatial repellents, such as transfluthrin, to protect  against mosquitoes in tropical settings. However, these observations relate to a  single prototype specimen of this particular device, therefore, much more  detailed, well replicated studies are essential to establish long-term efficacy,  effectiveness, practicability and affordability.},

Simplified arithmetic  models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination are presented in  user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore,  query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and  the world at large. Although the predictive model is broadly applicable, the  simulations presented are based on parameter values representative of the United  Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and  response to avert a national catastrophe. The predictions of these models  illustrate (1) why ambitious lock-down interventions to crush the curve represent  the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level  epidemics before they turn into outright catastrophes, (2) why these need to be  implemented so early, so stringently and for such extended periods, (3) why high  prevalence of other pathogens causing similar symptoms to mild COVID-19 precludes  the use of contact tracing as a substitute for lock down interventions to contain  and eliminate epidemics, (4) why partial containment strategies intended to  merely flatten the curve, by maintaining epidemics at manageably low levels, are  grossly unrealistic, and (5) why local elimination may only be sustained after  lock down ends if imported cases are comprehensively excluded, so international  co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries  certified as free of COVID-19 represents the best strategy for motivating  progress towards pandemic eradication at global level.

This study investigated  whether a captive pride of three Asiatic lions at Fota Wildlife Park in Ireland  exhibited typical patterns of territorial vocalizations and associated behaviors.  A total of 705 bouts of territorial vocalization were noted over 1 month of  near-continuous audio recording in the middle of winter in 2020. Also,  complementary visual observations were performed during regular daytime visits to  collect audio data and maintain recording equipment. These captive lions  exhibited generally similar territorial urine spraying, scent rubbing and  vocalization behaviors to their wild counterparts but differed in that they  primarily vocalized during daylight hours, including afternoons and late  mornings. While most roaring occurred during the day there was also a brief peak  just before dawn, between 07:00 and 08:00, and another after dusk, between 17:00  and 18:00. Vocalization activity tailed off after 22:00 and became infrequent  over the remaining hours of darkness. Although this contrasts starkly with the  predominantly nocturnal activity patterns of wild lions, it is consistent with  some reports from some other captive settings. Although the underlying reasons  for this habit of roaring throughout the day remain unclear, it is fortuitous  because the spectacular territorial vocalizations of these captive lions enrich  visitor experiences and may hopefully stimulate interest in travel to the low and  middle-income countries where tourist income is essential to sustain the  conservation areas they and many other species depend on.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, rapid and spontaneous scale-up of window screening occurred through purely horizontal commercial  distribution systems without any public subsidies or promotion. Scale-up of  window screening coincided with a planned evaluation of programmatic, vertically  managed scale-up of regular larvicide application as an intervention against  malaria vectors and transmission. We aimed to establish whether scale-up of  window screening was associated with suppression of mosquito populations,  especially for malaria vectors that strongly prefer humans as their source of  blood. METHODS: This study was a re-analysis of a previous observational series  of epidemiological data plus new analyses of previously partly reported  complementary entomological data, from Dar es Salaam. Between 2004 and 2008, six  rounds of cluster-sampled, rolling, cross-sectional parasitological and  questionnaire surveys were done in urban Dar es Salaam to assess the effect of  larviciding and other determinants of malaria risk, such as use of bed nets and  antimalarial drugs, socioeconomic status, age, sex, travel history,  mosquito-proofed housing, and spending time outdoors. The effects of scaled-up  larvicide application and window screening were estimated by fitting generalised  linear mixed models that allowed for both spatial variation between survey  locations and temporal autocorrelation within locations. We also conducted  continuous longitudinal entomological surveys of outdoor human biting rates by  mosquitoes and experimental measurements of mosquito host preferences. FINDINGS:  Best-fit models of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection prevalence among  humans were largely consistent with the results of the previous analyses.  Re-analysis of previously reported epidemiological data revealed that most of the  empirically fitted downward time trend in P falciparum malaria prevalence over  the course of the study (odds ratio [OR] 0·04; 95\% CI 0·03-0·06; p{\textless}0·0001), which  was not previously reported numerically or attributed to any explanatory factor,  could be plausibly explained by association with an upward trend in city-wide  window screening coverage (OR 0·07; 0·05-0·09; p{\textless}0·0001) and progressive rollout  of larviciding (OR 0·50; 0·41-0·60; p{\textless}0·0001). Increasing coverage of complete  window screening was also associated with reduced biting densities of all  taxonomic groups of mosquitoes (all p{\textless}0·0001), especially the Anopheles gambiae  complex (relative rate [RR] 0·23; 95\% CI 0·16-0·33) and Anopheles funestus group  (RR 0·08; 0·04-0·16), which were confirmed as the most efficient vectors of  malaria with strong preferences for humans over cattle. Larviciding was also  associated with reduced biting densities of all mosquito taxa (p{\textless}0·0001), to an  extent that varied consistently with the larvicide targeting scheme and known  larval ecology of each taxon. INTERPRETATION: Community-wide mosquito proofing of  houses might deliver greater impacts on vector populations and malaria  transmission than previously thought. The spontaneous nature of the scale-up  observed here is also encouraging with regards to practicality, acceptability,  and affordability in low-income settings.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mosquito age and species identification is a crucial determinant of the efficacy of vector control programmes. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has  previously been applied successfully to rapidly, non-destructively, and  simultaneously determine the age and species of freshly anesthetized African  malaria vectors from the Anopheles gambiae s.l. species complex: An. gambiae s.  s. and Anopheles arabiensis. However, this has only been achieved on  freshly-collected specimens and future applications will require samples to be  preserved between field collections and scanning by NIRS. In this study, a sample  preservation method (RNAlater(®)) was evaluated for mosquito age and species  identification by NIRS against scans of fresh samples. METHODS: Two strains of  An. gambiae s.s. (CDC and G3) and two strains of An. arabiensis (Dongola, KGB)  were reared in the laboratory while the third strain of An. arabiensis (Ifakara)  was reared in a semi-field system. All mosquitoes were scanned when fresh and  rescanned after preservation in RNAlater(®) for several weeks. Age and species  identification was determined using a cross-validation. RESULTS: The mean  accuracy obtained for predicting the age of young ({\textless}7 days) or old (≥ 7 days) of  all fresh (n = 633) and all preserved (n = 691) mosquito samples using the  cross-validation technique was 83\% and 90\%, respectively. For species  identification, accuracies were 82\% for fresh against 80\% for RNAlater(®)  preserved. For both analyses, preserving mosquitoes in RNAlater(®) was associated  with a highly significant reduction in the likelihood of a misclassification of  mosquitoes as young or old using NIRS. Important to note is that the costs for  preserving mosquito specimens with RNAlater(®) ranges from 3-13 cents per insect  depending on the size of the tube used and the number of specimens pooled in one  tube. CONCLUSION: RNAlater(®) can be used to preserve mosquitoes for subsequent  scanning and analysis by NIRS to determine their age and species with minimal  costs and with accuracy similar to that achieved from fresh insects. Cold storage  availability allows samples to be stored longer than a week after field  collection. Further study to develop robust calibrations applicable to other  strains from diverse ecological settings is recommended.},

Data from  human and An. funestus behavioral surveys were used to measure the human exposure  to An. funestus bites through previously described mathematical models. We  estimated the personal protection efficacy provided by LLINs and the proportions  of exposure to bite occurring indoors and/or in the early morning. Average  personal protection provided by using of LLIN was high (≥80\% of the total  exposure to bite), but for LLIN users, a large part of remaining exposure  occurred outdoors (45.1\% in Tokoli-V and 68.7\% in Lokohoué) and/or in the early  morning (38.5\% in Tokoli-V and 69.4\% in Lokohoué). This study highlights the  crucial role of LLIN use and the possible need to develop new vector control  strategies targeting malaria vectors with outdoor and early morning biting  behavior. This multidisciplinary approach that supplements entomology with social  science and mathematical modeling illustrates just how important it is to assess  where and when humans are actually exposed to malaria vectors before vector  control program managers, policy-makers and funders conclude what entomological  observations imply.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring mosquito population dynamics is essential to guide selection and evaluation of malaria vector control interventions but is typically  implemented by mobile, centrally-managed teams who can only visit a limited  number of locations frequently enough to capture longitudinal trends.  Community-based (CB) mosquito trapping schemes for parallel, continuous  monitoring of multiple locations are therefore required that are practical,  affordable, effective, and reliable. METHODS: A CB surveillance scheme, with a  monthly sampling and reporting cycle for capturing malaria vectors, using Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention light traps (LT) and Ifakara Tent Traps (ITT),  were conducted by trained community health workers (CHW) in 14 clusters of  households immediately surrounding health facilities in rural south-east Zambia.  At the end of the study, a controlled quality assurance (QA) survey was conducted  by a centrally supervised expert team using human landing catch (HLC), LT and ITT  to evaluate accuracy of the CB trapping data. Active surveillance of malaria  parasite infection rates amongst humans was conducted by CHWs in the same  clusters to determine the epidemiological relevance of these CB entomological  surveys. RESULTS: CB-LT and CB-ITT exhibited relative sampling efficiencies of 50  and 7\%, respectively, compared with QA surveys using the same traps. However,  cost per sampling night was lowest for CB-LT (\$13.6), followed closely by CB-ITT  (\$18.0), both of which were far less expensive than any QA survey (HLC: \$138, LT:  \$289, ITT: \$269). Cost per specimen of Anopheles funestus captured was lowest for  CB-LT (\$5.3), followed by potentially hazardous QA-HLC (\$10.5) and then CB-ITT  (\$28.0), all of which were far more cost-effective than QA-LT (\$141) and QA-ITT  (\$168). Time-trends of malaria diagnostic positivity (DP) followed those of An.  funestus density with a one-month lag and the wide range of mean DP across  clusters was closely associated with mean densities of An. funestus caught by  CB-LT (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CB trapping schemes appear to be far more  affordable, epidemiologically relevant and cost-effective than centrally  supervised trapping schemes and may well be applicable to enhance intervention  trials and even enable routine programmatic monitoring of vector population  dynamics on unprecedented national scales.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-lasting, insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are the most widely accepted and applied malaria vector control methods.  However, evidence that incremental impact is achieved when they are combined  remains limited and inconsistent. METHODS: Fourteen population clusters of  approximately 1000 residents each in Zambia's Luangwa and Nyimba districts, which  had high pre-existing usage rates (81.7 \%) of pyrethroid-impregnated LLINs were  quasi-randomly assigned to receive IRS with either of two pyrethroids, namely  deltamethrin [Wetable granules (WG)] and lambdacyhalothrin [capsule suspension  (CS)], with an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) or CS formulation of the  organophosphate pirimiphos methyl (PM), or with no supplementary vector control  measure. Diagnostic positivity of patients tested for malaria by community health  workers in these clusters was surveyed longitudinally over pre- and  post-treatment periods spanning 29 months, over which the treatments were  allocated and re-allocated in advance of three sequential rainy seasons. RESULTS:  Supplementation of LLINs with PM CS offered the greatest initial level of  protection against malaria in the first 3 months of application (incremental  protective efficacy (IPE) [95 \% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.63 [CI 0.57, 0.69],  P {\textless} 0.001), followed by lambdacyhalothrin (IPE [95 \% CI] = 0.31 [0.10, 0.47], P =  0.006) and PM EC (IPE, 0.23 [CI 0.15, 0.31], P {\textless} 0.001) and then by deltamethrin  (IPE [95 \% CI] = 0.19 [-0.01, 0.35], P = 0.064). Neither pyrethroid formulation  provided protection beyond 3 months after spraying, but the protection provided  by both PM formulations persisted undiminished for longer periods: 6 months for  CS and 12 months for EC. The CS formulation of PM provided greater protection  than the combined pyrethroid IRS formulations throughout its effective life IPE  [95 \% CI] = 0.79 [0.75, 0.83] over 6 months. The EC formulation of PM provided  incremental protection for the first 3 months (IPE [95 \% CI] = 0.23 [0.15, 0.31])  that was approximately equivalent to the two pyrethroid formulations  (lambdacyhalothrin, IPE [95 \% CI] = 0.31 [0.10, 0.47] and deltamethrin, IPE [95 \%  CI] = 0.19 [-0.01, 0.35]) but the additional protection provided by the former,  apparently lasted an entire year. CONCLUSION: Where universal coverage targets  for LLIN utilization has been achieved, supplementing LLINs with IRS using  pyrethroids may reduce malaria transmission below levels achieved by LLIN use  alone, even in settings where pyrethroid resistance occurs in the vector  population. However, far greater reduction of transmission can be achieved under  such conditions by supplementing LLINs with IRS using non-pyrethroid insecticide  classes, such as organophosphates, so this is a viable approach to mitigating and  managing pyrethroid resistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical entomologists increasingly recognize that the ability to make inferences between laboratory experiments of vector biology and epidemiological  trends observed in the field is hindered by a conceptual and methodological gap  occurring between these approaches which prevents hypothesis-driven empirical  research from being conducted on relatively large and environmentally realistic  scales. The development of Semi-Field Systems (SFS) has been proposed as the best  mechanism for bridging this gap. Semi-field systems are defined as enclosed  environments, ideally situated within the natural ecosystem of a target disease  vector and exposed to ambient environmental conditions, in which all features  necessary for its life cycle completion are present. Although the value of SFS as  a research tool for malaria vector biology is gaining recognition, only a few  such facilities exist worldwide and are relatively small in size ({\textless} 100 m2).  METHODS: The establishment of a 625 m2 state-of-the-art SFS for large-scale  experimentation on anopheline mosquito ecology and control within a rural area of  southern Tanzania, where malaria transmission intensities are amongst the highest  ever recorded, is described. RESULTS: A greenhouse frame with walls of mosquito  netting and a polyethylene roof was mounted on a raised concrete platform at the  Ifakara Health Institute. The interior of the SFS was divided into four separate  work areas that have been set up for a variety of research activities including  mass-rearing for African malaria vectors under natural conditions, high  throughput evaluation of novel mosquito control and trapping techniques,  short-term assays of host-seeking behaviour and olfaction, and longer-term  experimental investigation of anopheline population dynamics and gene flow within  a contained environment that simulates a local village domestic setting.  CONCLUSION: The SFS at Ifakara was completed and ready for use in under two  years. Preliminary observations indicate that realistic and repeatable  observations of anopheline behaviour are obtainable within the SFS, and that  habitat and climatic features representative of field conditions can be simulated  within it. As work begins in the SFS in Ifakara and others around the world, the  major opportunities and challenges to the successful application of this tool for  malaria vector research and control are discussed.},

Elucidation of the degree and cause of population structure is important for  predicting the spread of genetic traits such as insecticide resistance genes or  artificially engineered genes. Here the population genetics of An. gambiae s.s.  and An. arabiensis in the central, eastern and island regions of Tanzania were  compared. Microsatellite markers were screened in 33 collections of female An.  gambiae s.l., originating from 22 geographical locations, four of which were  sampled in two or three years between 2008 and 2010. An. gambiae were sampled  from six sites, An. arabiensis from 14 sites, and both species from two sites,  with an additional colonised insectary sample of each species. Frequencies of the  knock-down resistance (kdr) alleles 1014S and 1014F were also determined. An.  gambiae exhibited relatively high genetic differentiation (average pairwise  FST = 0.131), significant even between nearby samples, but without clear  geographical patterning. In contrast, An. arabiensis exhibited limited  differentiation (average FST = 0.015), but strong isolation-by-distance (Mantel  test r = 0.46, p = 0.0008). Most time-series samples of An. arabiensis were  homogeneous, suggesting general temporal stability of the genetic structure. An.  gambiae populations from Dar es Salaam and Bagamoyo were found to have high  frequencies of kdr 1014S (around 70\%), with almost 50\% homozygote but was at much  lower frequency on Unguja Island, with no. An. gambiae population genetic  differentiation was consistent with an island model of genetic structuring with  highly restricted gene flow, contrary to An. arabiensis which was consistent with  a stepping-stone model of extensive, but geographically-restricted gene flow.},

CASE  DESCRIPTION: The institutional evolution of a city-level, community-based LSM  programme over 14 years in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, illustrates how  operational research projects can contribute to public health governance and to  the establishment of sustainable service delivery programmes. Implementation,  management and governance of this LSM programme is framed within a nested set of  spatially-defined relationships between mosquitoes, residents, government and  research institutions that build upward from neighbourhood to city and national  scales. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: The clear hierarchical structure associated  with vertical, centralized management of decentralized, community-based service  delivery, as well as increasingly clear differentiation of partner roles and  responsibilities across several spatial scales, contributed to the evolution and  subsequent growth of the programme. CONCLUSIONS: The UMCP was based on the  principle of an integrated operational research project that evolved over time as  the City Council gradually took more responsibility for management. The central  role of Dar es Salaam's City Council in coordinating LSM implementation enabled  that flexibility; the institutionalization of management and planning in local  administrative structures enhanced community-mobilization and funding  possibilities at national and international levels. Ultimately, the high degree  of program ownership by the City Council and three municipalities, coupled with  catalytic donor funding and technical support from expert overseas partners have  enabled establishment of a sustainable, internally-funded programme implemented  by the National Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and supported by national  research and training institutes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bed nets reduce malaria-related illness and deaths, by forming a protective barrier around people sleeping under them. When impregnated with  long-lasting insecticide formulations they also repel or kill mosquitoes  attempting to feed upon sleeping humans, and can even suppress entire populations  of malaria vectors that feed predominantly upon humans. Nevertheless, an  epidemiological study in 2012 demonstrated higher malaria prevalence among bed  net users than non-users in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: Focus group  discussions were conducted with women from four selected wards of Dar es Salaam  city, focusing on four major themes relating to bed net use behaviours: (1)  reasons for bed net use, (2) reasons for not using bed nets, (3) stimuli or  reminders for people to use a bed net (4) perceived reasons for catching malaria  while using a bed net. An analytical method by framework grouping of relevant  themes was used address key issues of relevance to the study objectives. Codes  were reviewed and grouped into categories and themes. RESULTS: All groups said  the main reason for bed net use was protection against malaria. Houses with  well-screened windows, with doors that shut properly, and that use insecticidal  sprays against mosquitoes, were said not to use bed nets, while frequent attacks  from malaria was the main stimulus for people to use bed nets. Various reasons  were mentioned as potential reasons that compromise bed net efficacy, the most  common of which were: (1) bed net sharing by two or more people, especially if  one occupant tends to come to bed late at night, and does not tuck in the net  71\%; (2) one person shares the bed but does not use the net, moving it away from  the side on which s/he sleeps 68\%; (3) ineffective usage habits, called ulalavi,  in which a sprawling sleeper either touches the net while sleeping up against it  or leaves a limb hanging outside of it 68\%. Less common reasons mentioned  included: (1) Small bed nets which become un-tucked at night (31\%); (2) Bed nets  with holes large enough to allow mosquitoes to pass (28\%); and (3) Going to bed  late after already being bitten outdoors (24\%). CONCLUSIONS: Behaviours  associated with bed net use like; bed sharing, bed net non compliant-bedfellow,  sleeping pattern like ulalavi and some physical bed net attributes compromise its  effectiveness and supposedly increase of malaria infection to bed net users.

This study examines the distribution  of host-seeking malaria vectors at households within two villages in rural  Tanzania. METHODS: Host-seeking mosquitoes were sampled from 72 randomly selected  households in two villages on a monthly basis throughout 2008 using CDC  light-traps placed beside occupied nets. Spatial autocorrelation in the dataset  was examined using the Moran's I statistic and the location of any clusters was  identified using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Statistical associations between  the household characteristics and clusters of mosquitoes were assessed using a  generalized linear model for each species. RESULTS: For both Anopheles gambiae  sensu lato and Anopheles funestus, the density of host-seeking females was  spatially autocorrelated, or clustered. For both species, houses with low  densities were clustered in the semi-urban village centre while houses with high  densities were clustered in the periphery of the villages. Clusters of houses  with low or high densities of An. gambiae s.l. were influenced by the number of  residents in nearby houses. The occurrence of high-density clusters of An.  gambiae s.l. was associated with lower elevations while An. funestus was also  associated with higher elevations. Distance from the village centre was also  positively correlated with the number of household occupants and having houses  constructed with open eaves. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study  highlight that complementary vector control tools could be most effectively  targeted to the periphery of villages where the households potentially have a  higher hazard (mosquito densities) and vulnerability (open eaves and larger  households) to malaria infection.},

From June 2012 to January 2013, residential locations of patients  tested for malaria at a public health facility were traced based on their local  leaders' names and geo-referencing the point locations of these leaders' houses.  Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to visualise the spatial  distribution of malaria infection rates. Spatial scan statistics was deployed to  detect spatial clustering of high infection rates. Among 2407 patients tested for  malaria, 46.6\% (1121) could be traced to their 411 different residential housing  clusters. One small spatially aggregated cluster of neighbourhoods with high  prevalence was identified. While the home residence housing cluster leader was  unambiguously identified for 73.8\% (240/325) of malaria-positive patients, only  42.3\% (881/2082) of those with negative test results were successfully traced. It  was concluded that recording simple points of reference during routine health  facility visits can be used for mapping malaria infection burden on very fine  geographic scales, potentially offering a feasible approach to rational  geographic targeting of malaria control interventions. However, in order to tap  the full potential of this approach, it would be necessary to optimise patient  tracing success and eliminate biases by blinding personnel to test results.},

In urban Dar es Salaam, human landing catch  (HLC) is the only method sufficiently sensitive for monitoring  malaria-transmitting Anopheles. HLC is labour intensive, cumbersome, hazardous,  and requires such intense supervision that is difficulty to sustain on large  scales. METHODS: Novel tent traps were developed as alternatives to HLC. The  Furvela tent, designed in Mozambique, incorporates a CDC Light trap (LT)  components, while two others from Ifakara, Tanzania (designs A and B) require no  electricity or moving parts. Their sensitivity for sampling malaria vectors was  compared with LT and HLC over a wide range of vector abundances in rural and  urban settings in Tanzania, with endophagic and exophagic populations,  respectively, using randomised Latin-square and cross- over experimental designs.  RESULTS: The sensitivity of LTs was greater than HLC while the opposite was true  of Ifakara tent traps (crude mean catch of An. gambiae sensu lato relative to HLC  = 0.28, 0.65 and 1.30 for designs A, B and LT in a rural setting and 0.32 for  design B in an urban setting). However, Ifakara B catches correlated far better  to HLC (r2 = 0.73, P {\textless} 0.001) than any other method tested (r2 = 0.04, P = 0.426  and r2 = 0.19, P = 0.006 for Ifakara A and LTs respectively). Only Ifakara B in a  rural setting with high vector density exhibited constant sampling efficiency  relative to HLC. The relative sensitivity of Ifakara B increased as vector  densities decreased in the urban setting and exceeded that of HLC at the lowest  densities. None of the tent traps differed from HLC in terms of the proportions  of parous mosquitoes (P {\textgreater}or= 0.849) or An. gambiae s.l. sibling species (P {\textgreater}or=  0.280) they sampled but both Ifakara A and B designs failed to reduce the  proportion of blood-fed mosquitoes caught (Odds ratio [95\% Confidence Interval] =  1.6 [1.2, 2.1] and 1.0 [0.8, 1.2], P = 0.002 and 0.998, respectively), probably  because of operator exposure while emptying the trap each morning. CONCLUSION:  The Ifakara B trap may have potential for monitoring and evaluating a variety of  endophagic and exophagic Afrotropical malaria vectors, particularly at low but  epidemiologically relevant population densities. However, operator exposure to  mosquito bites remains a concern so additional modifications or protective  measures will be required before this design can be considered for widespread,  routine use.},

Evidence that electronic reporting of malaria cases by  community health workers (CHWs) meet these requirements remains limited.  METHODOLOGY: Residents of two adjacent rural districts in Zambia were provided  with both passive and active malaria testing and treatment services with malaria  rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy by 42  CHWs serving 14 population clusters centred around public sector health  facilities. Reference data describing total numbers of RDT-detected infections  and diagnostic positivity (DP) were extracted from detailed participant register  books kept by CHWs. These were compared with equivalent weekly summaries relayed  directly by the CHWs themselves through a mobile phone short messaging system  (SMS) reporting platform. RESULTS: Slightly more RDT-detected malaria infections  were recorded in extracted participant registers than were reported in weekly  mobile phone summaries but the difference was equivalent to only 19.2\% (31,665  versus 25,583, respectively). The majority (81\%) of weekly SMS reports were  received within one week and the remainder within one month. Overall mean [95\%  confidence limits] difference between the numbers of register-recorded and  SMS-reported RDT-detected malaria infections per CHW per week, as estimated by  the Bland Altman method, was only -2.3 [-21.9, 17.2]. The mean [range] for both  the number of RDT-detected malaria infections (86 [0, 463] versus 73.6 [0, 519],  respectively)) and DP (22.8\% [0.0 to 96.3\%] versus 23.2\% [0.4 to 75.8\%],  respectively) reported by SMS were generally very consistent with those recorded  in the reference paper-based register data and exhibited similar seasonality  patterns across all study clusters. Overall, mean relative differences in the SMS  reports and reference register data were more consistent with each other for DP  than for absolute numbers of RDT-detected infections, presumably because this  indicator is robust to variations in patient reporting rates by location,  weather, season and calendar event because these are included in both the  nominator and denominator. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The SMS reports captured  malaria transmission trends with adequate accuracy and could be used for  population-wide, continuous, longitudinal monitoring of malaria transmission.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The success of sterile or transgenic Anopheles for malaria control depends on their mating competitiveness within wild populations. Current evidence  suggests that transgenic mosquitoes have reduced fitness. One means of  compensating for this fitness deficit would be to identify environmental  conditions that increase their mating competitiveness, and incorporate them into  laboratory rearing regimes. METHODS: Anopheles gambiae larvae were allocated to  three crowding treatments with the same food input per larva. Emerged males were  competed against one another for access to females, and their corresponding  longevity and energetic reserves measured. RESULTS: Males from the low-crowding  treatment were much more likely to acquire the first mating. They won the first  female approximately 11 times more often than those from the high-crowding  treatment (Odds ratio = 11.17) and four times more often than those from the  medium-crowding treatment (Odds ratio = 3.51). However, there was no overall  difference in the total number of matings acquired by males from different  treatments (p = 0.08). The survival of males from the low crowding treatment was  lower than those from other treatments. The body size and teneral reserves of  adult males did not differ between crowding treatments, but larger males were  more likely to acquire mates than small individuals. CONCLUSION: Larval crowding  and body size have strong, independent effects on the mating competitiveness of  adult male An. gambiae. Thus manipulation of larval crowding during mass rearing  could provide a simple technique for boosting the competitiveness of sterile or  transgenic male mosquitoes prior to release.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Across most of sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex, comprising seven morphologically  indistinguishable but behaviourally-diverse sibling species with  ecologically-distinct environmental niches. Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis  are the mostly widely distributed major malaria vectors within the complex, while  An. quadriannulatus is sparsely distributed. METHODS: Indoor residual spraying  (IRS) with the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl (PM) was conducted four times  between 2011 and 2017 in the Luangwa Valley, south-east Zambia. Anopheles  mosquitoes were repeatedly collected indoors by several experiments with various  objectives conducted in this study area from 2010 onwards. Indoor mosquito  collection methods included human landing catches, Centres for Disease Control  and Prevention miniature light traps and back pack aspirators. Anopheles gambiae  complex mosquitoes were morphologically identified to species level using  taxonomic keys, and to molecular level by polymerase chain reaction. These  multi-study data were collated so that time trends in the species composition of  this complex could be assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of indoor An. gambiae  complex accounted for by An. quadriannulatus declined from 95.1\% to 69.7\%  following two application PM-IRS rounds with an emulsifiable concentrate  formulation from 2011 to 2013, while insecticidal net utilisation remained  consistently high throughout that period. This trend continued after two further  rounds of PM-IRS with a longer-lasting capsule suspension formulation in 2015 and  2016/2017, following which An. quadriannulatus accounted for only 4.5\% of the  complex. During the same time interval there was a correspondingly steady rise in  the proportional contribution of An. arabiensis to the complex, from 3.9 to  95.1\%, while the contribution of nominate An. gambiae remained stable at ≤ 0.9\%.  CONCLUSION: It seems likely that An. arabiensis is not only more behaviourally  resilient against IRS than An. gambiae, but also than An. quadriannulatus  populations exhibiting indoor-feeding, human-feeding and nocturnal behaviours  that are unusual for this species. Routine, programmatic entomological monitoring  of dynamic vector population guilds will be critical to guide effective selection  and deployment of vector control interventions, including supplementary measures  to tackle persisting vectors of residual malaria transmission like An.  arabiensis.},

METHODS: Three rounds of  city-wide, cluster-sampled cross-sectional surveys of malaria parasite infection  status, spanning 2010 to 2012, were complemented by two series of  high-resolution, longitudinal surveys of vector density. RESULTS: Larvicide  application using a granule formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis var.  israelensis (Bti) had no effect upon either vector density (P = 0.820) or  infection prevalence (P = 0.325) when managed by a private-sector contractor.  Infection prevalence rebounded back to 13.8 \% in 2010, compared with {\textless}2 \% at the  end of a previous Bti LA evaluation in 2008. Following transition to management  by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW), LA consistently reduced  vector densities, first using the same Bti granule in early 2011 [odds ratio (OR)  (95 \% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.31 (0.14, 0.71), P = 0.0053] and then a  pre-diluted aqueous suspension formulation from mid 2011 onwards [OR (95 \%  CI) = 0.15 (0.07, 0.30), P ≪ 0.000001]. While LA by MoHSW with the granule  formulation was associated with reduced infection prevalence [OR (95 \% CI) = 0.26  (0.12, 0.56), P = 0.00040], subsequent liquid suspension use, following a mass  distribution to achieve universal coverage of LLINs that reduced vector density  [OR (95 \% CI) = 0.72 (0.51, 1.01), P = 0.057] and prevalence [OR (95 \% CI) = 0.80  (0.69, 0.91), P = 0.0013], was not associated with further prevalence reduction  (P = 0.836). Sleeping inside houses with complete window screens only reduced  infection risk [OR (95 \% CI) = 0.71 (0.62, 0.82), P = 0.0000036] if the evenings  and mornings were also spent indoors. Furthermore, infection risk was only  associated with local vector density [OR (95 \% CI) = 6.99 (1.12, 43.7) at one  vector mosquito per trap per night, P = 0.037] among the minority (14 \%) of  households lacking screening. Despite attenuation of malaria transmission and  immunity, 88 \% of infected residents experienced no recent fever, only 0.4 \% of  these afebrile cases had been treated for malaria, and prevalence remained high  (9.9 \%) at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: While existing vector control  interventions have dramatically attenuated malaria transmission in Dar es Salaam,  further scale-up and additional measures to protect against mosquito bites  outdoors are desirable. Accelerated elimination of chronic human infections  persisting at high prevalence will require active, population-wide campaigns with  curative drugs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission in Africa occurs predominantly inside houses where the primary vectors prefer to feed. Human preference and investment in  blocking of specific entry points for mosquitoes into houses was evaluated and  compared with known entry point preferences of the mosquitoes themselves.  METHODS: Cross-sectional household surveys were conducted in urban Dar es Salaam,  Tanzania to estimate usage levels of available options for house proofing against  mosquito entry, namely window screens, ceilings and blocking of eaves. These  surveys also enabled evaluation of household expenditure on screens and ceilings  and the motivation behind their installation. RESULTS: Over three quarters  (82.8\%) of the 579 houses surveyed in Dar es Salaam had window screens, while  almost half (48.9\%) had ceilings. Prevention of mosquito entry was cited as a  reason for installation of window screens and ceilings by 91.4\% (394/431) and  55.7\% (127/228) of respondents, respectively, but prevention of malaria was  rarely cited (4.3\%, 22/508). The median cost of window screens was between US \$  21-30 while that of ceilings was between US \$301-400. The market value of  insecticide-treated nets, window screening and ceilings currently in use in the  city was estimated as 2, 5 and 42 million US\$. More than three quarters of the  respondents that lacked them said it was too expensive to install ceilings  (82.2\%) or window screens (75.5\%). CONCLUSION: High coverage and spending on  screens and ceilings implies that these techniques are highly acceptable and  excellent uptake can be achieved in urban settings like Dar es Salaam. Effective  models for promotion and subsidization should be developed and evaluated,  particularly for installation of ceilings that prevent entry via the eaves, which  are the most important entry point for mosquitoes that cause malaria, a variety  of neglected tropical diseases and the nuisance which motivates uptake.},

Here  mosquito biting patterns in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania are examined and the  protection against exposure to malaria transmission that is afforded to residents  by using an insecticide-treated net (ITN) is estimated. METHODS: Mosquito biting  activity over the course of the night was estimated by human landing catch in 216  houses and 1,064 residents were interviewed to determine usage of protection  measures and the proportion of each hour of the night spent sleeping indoors,  awake indoors, and outdoors. RESULTS: Hourly variations in biting activity by  members of the Anopheles gambiae complex were consistent with classical reports  but the proportion of these vectors caught outdoors in Dar es Salaam was almost  double that of rural Tanzania. Overall, ITNs confer less protection against  exophagic vectors in Dar es Salaam than in rural southern Tanzania (59\% versus  70\%). More alarmingly, a biting activity maximum that precedes 10 pm and much  lower levels of ITN protection against exposure (38\%) were observed for Anopheles  arabiensis, a vector of modest importance locally, but which predominates  transmission in large parts of Africa. CONCLUSION: In a situation of changing  mosquito and human behaviour, ITNs may confer lower, but still useful, levels of  personal protection which can be complemented by communal transmission  suppression at high coverage. Mosquito-proofing houses appeared to be the  intervention of choice amongst residents and further options for preventing  outdoor transmission include larviciding and environmental management.},

Elimination of malaria transmission  from urban areas may require larval control strategies that complement adult  mosquito control using insecticide-treated nets or houses, particularly where  vectors feed outdoors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Microbial larvicide (Bacillus  thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti)) was applied weekly through programmatic,  non-randomized community-based, but vertically managed, delivery systems in urban  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Continuous, randomized cluster sampling of malaria  infection prevalence and non-random programmatic surveillance of entomological  inoculation rate (EIR) respectively constituted the primary and secondary  outcomes surveyed within a population of approximately 612,000 residents in 15  fully urban wards covering 55 km(2). Bti application for one year in 3 of those  wards (17 km(2) with 128,000 residents) reduced crude annual transmission  estimates (Relative EIR [95\% Confidence Interval] = 0.683 [0.491-0.952], P =  0.024) but program effectiveness peaked between July and September (Relative EIR  [CI] = 0.354 [0.193 to 0.650], P = 0.001) when 45\% (9/20) of directly observed  transmission events occurred. Larviciding reduced malaria infection risk among  children {\textless} or =5 years of age (OR [CI] = 0.284 [0.101 to 0.801], P = 0.017) and  provided protection at least as good as personal use of an insecticide treated  net (OR [CI] = 0.764 [0.614-0.951], P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: In this context,  larviciding reduced malaria prevalence and complemented existing protection  provided by insecticide-treated nets. Larviciding may represent a useful option  for integrated vector management in Africa, particularly in its rapidly growing  urban centres.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current front line malaria vector control methods such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), rely upon the  preference of many primary vectors to feed and/or rest inside human habitations  where they can be targeted with domestically-applied insecticidal products. We  studied the human biting behaviour of the malaria vector Anopheles funestus Giles  and the potential malaria vector Anopheles quadriannulatus Theobald in Luangwa  valley, south-east Zambia. METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected by human landing  catch in blocks of houses with either combined use of deltamethrin-based IRS and  LLINs or LLINs alone. Human behaviour data were collected to estimate how much  exposure to mosquito bites indoors and outdoors occurred at various times of the  night for LLIN users and non-users. RESULTS: Anopheles funestus and An.  quadriannulatus did not show preference to bite either indoors or outdoors: the  proportions [95\% confidence interval] caught indoors were 0.586 [0.303, 0.821]  and 0.624 [0.324, 0.852], respectively. However, the overwhelming majority of  both species were caught at times when most people are indoors. The proportion of  mosquitoes caught at a time when most people are indoors were 0.981 [0.881,  0.997] and 0.897 [0.731, 0.965], respectively, so the proportion of human  exposure to both species occuring indoors was high for individuals lacking LLINs  (An. funestus: 0.983 and An. quadriannulatus: 0.970, respectively). While LLIN  users were better protected, more than half of their exposure was nevertheless  estimated to occur indoors (An. funestus: 0.570 and An. quadriannulatus: 0.584).  CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of human exposure to both An. funestus and An.  quadriannulatus occuring indoors was high in the area and hence both species  might be responsive to further peri-domestic measures if these mosquitoes are  susceptible to insecticidal products.},

Such comparison is especially important in cases where laboratory-derived  information is used to formulate and implement strategies for the genetic control  of insects in nature. We have conducted a comparative study of the reproductive  potential and life history of male Anopheles gambiae Gilies sensu lato mosquitoes  from both standardized laboratory conditions and from natural field settings. We  measured three indirect indicators of male mosquito fitness: energetic reserves,  body size and survival, in a bid to determine whether the demographics and  energetic limitations of wild males can be correctly predicted from their  laboratory counterparts. Crucially, the body size and lipid reserves of wild  males were substantially greater than those reared under standard laboratory  conditions. We caution that the energetic limitations of insects as identified in  the laboratory may underestimate their resilience in the wild, and discuss the  implications of this phenomenon with respect to vector-borne disease control  programmes based on genetic control of mosquitoes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Release of genetically-modified (GM) or sterile male mosquitoes for malaria control is hampered by inability to assess the age and mating history of  free-living male Anopheles. METHODS: Age and mating-related changes in the  reproductive system of male Anopheles gambiae were quantified and used to fit  predictive statistical models. These models, based on numbers of spermatocysts,  relative size of sperm reservoir and presence/absence of a clear area around the  accessory gland, were evaluated using an independent sample of mosquitoes whose  status was blinded during the experiment. RESULTS: The number of spermatocysts in  male testes decreased with age, and the relative size of their sperm reservoir  increased. The presence of a clear area around accessory glands was also linked  to age and mating status. A quantitative model was able to categorize males from  the blind trial into age groups of young ({\textless} or = 4 days) and old ({\textgreater} 4 days) with  an overall efficiency of 89\%. Using the parameters of this model, a simple table  was compiled that can be used to predict male age. In contrast, mating history  could not be reliably assessed as virgins could not be distinguished from mated  males. CONCLUSION: Simple assessment of a few morphological traits which are  easily collected in the field allows accurate age-grading of male An. gambiae.  This simple, yet robust, model enables evaluation of demographic patterns and  mortality in wild and released males in populations targeted by GM or sterile  male-based control programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dar es Salaam has an extensive drain network, mostly with inadequate water flow, blocked by waste, causing flooding after rainfall. The presence of  Anopheles and Culex larvae is common, which is likely to impact the transmission  of lymphatic filariasis and malaria by the resulting adult mosquito populations.  However, the importance of drains as larval habitats remains unknown.  METHODOLOGY: Data on mosquito larval habitats routinely collected by the Urban  Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special drain survey conducted in 2006 were  used to obtain a typology of habitats. Focusing on drains, logistic regression  was used to evaluate potential factors impacting the presence of mosquito larvae.  Spatial variation in the proportion of habitats that contained larvae was  assessed through the local Moran's I indicator of spatial association. PRINCIPAL  FINDINGS: More than 70\% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam were human-made.  Aquatic habitats associated with agriculture had the highest proportion of  Anopheles larvae presence and the second highest of Culex larvae presence.  However, the majority of aquatic habitats were drains (42\%), and therefore, 43\%  (1,364/3,149) of all culicine and 33\% (320/976) of all anopheline positive  habitats were drains. Compared with drains where water was flowing at normal  velocity, the odds of finding Anopheles and Culex larvae were 8.8 and 6.3  (p{\textless}0.001) times larger, respectively, in drains with stagnant water. There was a  positive association between vegetation and the presence of mosquito larvae  (p{\textless}0.001). The proportion of habitats with mosquito larvae was spatially  correlated. CONCLUSION: Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the  potential to eliminate more than 40\% of all potential mosquito larval habitats  that are currently treated with larvicides by the UMCP. The importance of  human-made larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors  underscores the need for a synergy between on-going control efforts of those  diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Operational vector sampling methods lack standardization, making quantitative comparisons of malaria transmission across different settings  difficult. Human landing catch (HLC) is considered the research gold standard for  measuring human-mosquito contact, but is unsuitable for large-scale sampling.  This study assessed mosquito catch rates of CDC light trap (CDC-LT), Ifakara tent  trap (ITT), window exit trap (WET), pot resting trap (PRT), and box resting trap  (BRT) relative to HLC in western Kenya to 1) identify appropriate methods for  operational sampling in this region, and 2) contribute to a larger, overarching  project comparing standardized evaluations of vector trapping methods across  multiple countries. METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected from June to July 2009 in  four districts: Rarieda, Kisumu West, Nyando, and Rachuonyo. In each district,  all trapping methods were rotated 10 times through three houses in a 3 × 3 Latin  Square design. Anophelines were identified by morphology and females classified  as fed or non-fed. Anopheles gambiae s.l. were further identified as Anopheles  gambiae s.s. or Anopheles arabiensis by PCR. Relative catch rates were estimated  by negative binomial regression. RESULTS: When data were pooled across all four  districts, catch rates (relative to HLC indoor) for An. gambiae s.l (95.6\% An.  arabiensis, 4.4\% An. gambiae s.s) were high for HLC outdoor (RR = 1.01), CDC-LT  (RR = 1.18), and ITT (RR = 1.39); moderate for WET (RR = 0.52) and PRT outdoor  (RR = 0.32); and low for all remaining types of resting traps (PRT indoor, BRT  indoor, and BRT outdoor; RR {\textless} 0.08 for all). For Anopheles funestus, relative  catch rates were high for ITT (RR = 1.21); moderate for HLC outdoor (RR = 0.47),  CDC-LT (RR = 0.69), and WET (RR = 0.49); and low for all resting traps (RR {\textless} 0.02  for all). At finer geographic scales, however, efficacy of each trap type varied  from district to district. CONCLUSIONS: ITT, CDC-LT, and WET appear to be  effective methods for large-scale vector sampling in western Kenya. Ultimately,  choice of collection method for operational surveillance should be driven by trap  efficacy and scalability, rather than fine-scale precision with respect to HLC.  When compared with recent, similar trap evaluations in Tanzania and Zambia, these  data suggest that traps which actively lure host-seeking females will be most  useful for surveillance in the face of declining vector densities.},

A  large-scale larviciding programme in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania is supported  by a community-based (CB) system for trapping adult mosquito densities to monitor  programme performance. METHODOLOGY: An intensive and extensive CB system for  routine, longitudinal, programmatic surveillance of malaria vectors and other  mosquitoes using the Ifakara Tent Trap (ITT-C) was developed in Urban Dar es  Salaam, Tanzania, and validated by comparison with quality assurance (QA) surveys  using either ITT-C or human landing catches (HLC), as well as a cross-sectional  survey of malaria parasite prevalence in the same housing compounds. RESULTS:  Community-based ITT-C had much lower sensitivity per person-night of sampling  than HLC (Relative Rate (RR) [95\% Confidence Interval (CI)] = 0.079 [0.051,  0.121], P {\textless} 0.001 for Anopheles gambiae s.l. and 0.153 [0.137, 0.171], P {\textless} 0.001  for Culicines) but only moderately differed from QA surveys with the same trap  (0.536 [0.406,0.617], P = 0.001 and 0.747 [0.677,0.824], P {\textless} 0.001, for An.  gambiae or Culex respectively). Despite the poor sensitivity of the ITT per night  of sampling, when CB-ITT was compared with QA-HLC, it proved at least comparably  sensitive in absolute terms (171 versus 169 primary vectors caught) and  cost-effective (153US\$ versus 187US\$ per An. gambiae caught) because it allowed  more spatially extensive and temporally intensive sampling (4284 versus 335 trap  nights distributed over 615 versus 240 locations with a mean number of samples  per year of 143 versus 141). Despite the very low vectors densities (Annual  estimate of about 170 An gambiae s.l bites per person per year), CB-ITT was the  only entomological predictor of parasite infection risk (Odds Ratio [95\%  CI] = 4.43[3.027,7. 454] per An. gambiae or Anopheles funestus caught per night,  P =0.0373). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: CB trapping approaches could be improved  with more sensitive traps, but already offer a practical, safe and affordable  system for routine programmatic mosquito surveillance and clusters could be  distributed across entire countries by adapting the sample submission and quality  assurance procedures accordingly.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable quantification of mosquito host-seeking behaviours is required to determine the efficacy of vector control methods. For malaria, the  gold standard approach remains the risky human landing catch (HLC). Here compare  the performance of an improved prototype of the mosquito electrocuting grid trap  (MET) as a safer alternative with HLC for measuring malaria vector behaviour in  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: Mosquito trapping was conducted at three sites  within Dar es Salaam representing a range of urbanicity over a 7-month period  (December 2012-July 2013, 168 sampling nights). At each site, sampling was  conducted in a block of four houses, with two houses being allocated to HLC and  the other to MET on each night of study. Sampling was conducted both indoors and  outdoors (from 19:00 to 06:00 each night) at all houses, with trapping method  (HLC and MET) being exchanged between pairs of houses at each site using a  crossover design. RESULTS: The MET caught significantly more Anopheles gambiae  sensu lato than the HLC, both indoors (RR [95 \% confidence interval (CI)]) = 1.47  [1.23-1.76], P {\textless} 0.0001 and outdoors = 1.38 [1.14-1.67], P {\textless} 0.0001). The  sensitivity of MET compared with HLC did not detectably change over the course of  night for either An. gambiae s.l. (OR [CI]) = 1.01 [0.94-1.02], P = 0.27) or  Culex spp. (OR [CI]) = 0.99 [0.99-1.0], P = 0.17) indoors and declined only  slightly outdoors: An. gambiae s.l. (OR [CI]) = 0.92 [0.86-0.99], P = 0.04), and  Culex spp. (OR [CI]) = 0.99 [0.98-0.99], P = 0.03). MET-based estimates of the  proportions of mosquitoes caught indoors (P i ) or during sleeping hours (P fl ),  as well as the proportion of human exposure to bites that would otherwise occurs  indoors (π i ), were statistically indistinguishable from those based on HLC for  An. gambiae s.l. (P = 0.43, 0.07 and 0.48, respectively) and Culex spp.  (P = 0.76, 0.24 and 0.55, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This improved MET prototype  is highly sensitive tool that accurately quantifies epidemiologically-relevant  metrics of mosquito biting densities, behaviours and human exposure distribution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria control is threatened by  resistance to commonly used pyrethroid insecticides. Rotations, mosaics,  combinations, or mixtures of insecticides from different complementary classes  are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for mitigating against  resistance, but many of the alternatives to pyrethroids are prohibitively  expensive to apply in large national IRS campaigns. Recent evaluations of window  screens and eave baffles (WSEBs) treated with pirimiphos-methyl (PM), to  selectively target insecticides inside houses, demonstrated malaria vector  mortality rates equivalent or superior to IRS. However, the durability of  efficacy when co-applied with polyacrylate-binding agents (BA) remains to be  established. This study evaluated whether WSEBs, co-treated with PM and BA have  comparable wash resistance to LLINs and might therefore remain insecticidal for  years rather than months. METHODS: WHO-recommended wire ball assays of  insecticidal efficacy were applied to polyester netting treated with or without  BA plus 1 or 2 g/sq m PM. They were then tested for insecticidal efficacy using  fully susceptible insectary-reared Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, following 0, 5,  10, 15, then 20 washes as per WHO-recommended protocols for accelerated ageing of  LLINs. This was followed by a small-scale field trial in experimental huts to  measure malaria vector mortality achieved by polyester netting WSEBs treated with  BA and 2 g/sq m PM after 0, 10 and then 20 standardized washes, alongside  recently applied IRS using PM. RESULTS: Co-treatment with BA and either dosage of  PM remained insecticidal over 20 washes in the laboratory. In experimental huts,  WSEBs treated with PM plus BA consistently killed similar proportions of  Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes to PM-IRS (both consistently ≥ 94\%), even after  20 washes. CONCLUSION: Co-treating WSEBs with both PM and BA results in  wash-resistant insecticidal activity comparable with LLINs. Insecticide  treatments for WSEBs may potentially last for years rather than months,  therefore, reducing insecticide consumption by an order of magnitude relative to  IRS. However, durability of WSEBs will still have to be assessed in real houses  under representative field conditions of exposure to wear and tear, sunlight and  rain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrated vector management (IVM) for malaria control requires ecological skills that are very scarce and rarely applied in Africa today.  Partnerships between communities and academic ecologists can address this  capacity deficit, modernize the evidence base for such approaches and enable  future scale up. METHODS: Community-based IVM programmes were initiated in two  contrasting settings. On Rusinga Island, Western Kenya, community outreach to a  marginalized rural community was achieved by University of Nairobi through a  community-based organization. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Ilala Municipality  established an IVM programme at grassroots level, which was subsequently upgraded  and expanded into a pilot scale Urban Malaria Control Programme with support from  national academic institutes. RESULTS: Both programmes now access relevant  expertise, funding and policy makers while the academic partners benefit from  direct experience of community-based implementation and operational research  opportunities. The communities now access up-to-date malaria-related knowledge  and skills for translation into local action. Similarly, the academic partners  have acquired better understanding of community needs and how to address them.  CONCLUSION: Until sufficient evidence is provided, community-based IVM remains an  operational research activity. Researchers can never directly support every  community in Africa so community-based IVM strategies and tactics will need to be  incorporated into undergraduate teaching programmes to generate sufficient  numbers of practitioners for national scale programmes. Academic ecologists at  African institutions are uniquely positioned to enable the application of  practical environmental and entomological skills for malaria control by  communities at grassroots level and should be supported to fulfil this neglected  role.},

However, it is not clear  whether ITT catches represent indoors or outdoors biting densities. ITT do not  yield samples of resting, fed mosquitoes for blood meal analysis. METHODS:  Outdoors mosquito sampling methods, namely human landing catch (HLC), ITT (Design  B) and resting boxes (RB) were conducted in parallel with indoors sampling using  HLC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps (LT) and RB  as well as window exit traps (WET) in urban Dar es Salaam, rotating them thirteen  times through a 3 × 3 Latin Square experimental design replicated in four blocks  of three houses. This study was conducted between 6th May and 2rd July 2008,  during the main rainy season when mosquito biting densities reach their annual  peak. RESULTS: The mean sensitivities of indoor RB, outdoor RB, WET, LT, ITT  (Design B) and HLC placed outdoor relative to HLC placed indoor were 0.01, 0.005,  0.036, 0.052, 0.374, and 1.294 for Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (96\% An. gambiae  s.s and 4\% An. arabiensis), respectively, and 0.017, 0.053, 0.125, 0.423, 0.372  and 1.140 for Culex spp, respectively. The ITT (Design B) catches correlated  slightly better to indoor HLC (r(2) = 0.619, P {\textless} 0.001, r(2) = 0.231, P = 0.001)  than outdoor HLC (r(2) = 0.423, P {\textless} 0.001, r(2) = 0.228, P = 0.001) for An.  gambiae s.l. and Culex spp respectively but the taxonomic composition of  mosquitoes caught by ITT does not match those of the indoor HLC (χ(2) = 607.408,  degrees of freedom = 18, P {\textless} 0.001). The proportion of An. gambiae caught indoors  was unaffected by the use of an LLIN in that house. CONCLUSION: The RB, WET and  LT are poor methods for surveillance of malaria vector densities in urban Dar es  Salaam compared to ITT and HLC but there is still uncertainty over whether the  ITT best reflects indoor or outdoor biting densities. The particular LLIN  evaluated here failed to significantly reduce house entry by An. gambiae s.l.  suggesting a negligible repellence effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frequent, sensitive and accurate sampling of Anopheles mosquitoes is a prerequisite for effective management of malaria vector control programmes. The  most reliable existing means to measure mosquito density is the human landing  catch (HLC). However, the HLC technique raises major ethical concerns because of  the necessity to expose humans to vectors of malaria and a variety of other  pathogens. Furthermore, it is a very arduous undertaking that requires intense  supervision, which is severely limiting in terms of affordability and  sustainability. METHODS: A community-based, mosquito sampling protocol, using the  Ifakara tent trap-B (ITT-B) and standardized resting boxes (SRB), was developed  and evaluated in terms of the number and sample composition of mosquitoes caught  by each, compared to rigorously controlled HLC. Mosquitoes were collected once  and three times every week by the HLC and the alternative methods, respectively,  in the same time and location. RESULTS: Overall, the three traps caught 44,848  mosquitoes. The ITT-B, HLC and SRB caught 168, 143 and 46 Anopheles gambiae s.l.  as well as 26,315, 13,258 and 4,791 Culex species respectively. The ITT-B was  three- and five-times cheaper than the HLC per mosquito caught for An. gambiae  and Cx. Species, respectively. Significant correlations between the numbers  caught by HLC and ITT-B were observed for both An. gambiae s.l. (P {\textless} 0.001) and  Cx. species (P = 0.003). Correlation between the catches with HLC and SRB were  observed for Cx. species (P {\textless} 0.001) but not An. gambiae s.l. (P = 0.195),  presumably because of the low density of the latter. Neither ITT-B nor SRB  exhibited any obvious density dependence for sampling the two species.  CONCLUSION: SRBs exhibited poor sensitivity for both mosquito taxa and are not  recommended in this setting. However, this protocol is affordable and effective  for routine use of the ITT-B under programmatic conditions. Nevertheless, it is  recommended that the trap and the protocol be evaluated further at full  programmatic scales to establish effectiveness under fully representative  conditions of routine practice.},

The study assessed the effectiveness of operational, community-based  larval habitat surveillance systems within the Urban Malaria Control Programme  (UMCP) in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were  carried out to assess the ability of community-owned resource persons (CORPs) to  detect mosquito breeding sites and larvae in areas with and without larviciding.  Potential environmental and programmatic determinants of habitat detection  coverage and detection sensitivity of mosquito larvae were recorded during guided  walks with 64 different CORPs to assess the accuracy of data each had collected  the previous day. RESULTS: CORPs reported the presence of 66.2\% of all aquatic  habitats (1,963/2,965), but only detected Anopheles larvae in 12.6\% (29/230) of  habitats that contained them. Detection sensitivity was particularly low for  late-stage Anopheles (2.7\%, 3/111), the most direct programmatic indicator of  malaria vector productivity. Whether a CORP found a wet habitat or not was  associated with his/her unfamiliarity with the area (Odds Ratio (OR) [95\%  confidence interval (CI)] = 0.16 [0.130, 0.203], P {\textless} 0.001), the habitat type (P  {\textless} 0.001) or a fence around the compound (OR [95\%CI] = 0.50 [0.386, 0.646], P {\textless}  0.001). The majority of mosquito larvae (Anophelines 57.8\% (133/230) and  Culicines 55.9\% (461/825) were not reported because their habitats were not  found. The only factor affecting detection of Anopheline larvae in habitats that  were reported by CORPs was larviciding, which reduced sensitivity (OR [95\%CI] =  0.37 [0.142, 0.965], P = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Accessibility of habitats in urban  settings presents a major challenge because the majority of compounds are fenced  for security reasons. Furthermore, CORPs under-reported larvae especially where  larvicides were applied. This UMCP system for larval surveillance in cities must  be urgently revised to improve access to enclosed compounds and the sensitivity  with which habitats are searched for larvae.},

By 2001-03,  following high usage rates (75\% of all age groups) of untreated bed nets, a  4.2-fold reduction in malaria transmission intensity was achieved. Since 2006, a  national-scale programme has promoted the use of longer-lasting insecticide  treatment kits (consisting of an insecticide plus binder) co-packaged with all  bed nets manufactured in the country. METHODS: The entomological inoculation rate  (EIR) was estimated through monthly surveys in 72 houses randomly selected in  each of the two villages. Mosquitoes were caught using CDC light traps placed  beside occupied bed nets between January and December 2008 (n = 1,648 trap  nights). Sub-samples of mosquitoes were taken from each trap to determine parity  status, sporozoite infection and Anopheles gambiae complex sibling species  identity. RESULTS: Compared with a historical mean EIR of approximately 1400  infectious bites/person/year (ib/p/y) in 1990-94; the 2008 estimate of 81 ib/p/y  represents an 18-fold reduction for an unprotected person without a net. The  combined impact of longer-lasting insecticide treatments as well as high bed net  coverage was associated with a 4.6-fold reduction in EIR, on top of the impact  from the use of untreated nets alone. The scale-up of bed nets and subsequent  insecticidal treatment has reduced the density of the anthropophagic, endophagic  primary vector species, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, by 79\%. In contrast, the  reduction in density of the zoophagic, exophagic sibling species Anopheles  arabiensis was only 38\%. CONCLUSION: Insecticide treatment of nets reduced the  intensity of malaria transmission in addition to that achieved by the untreated  nets alone. Impacts were most pronounced against the highly anthropophagic,  endophagic primary vector, leading to a shift in the sibling species composition  of the A. gambiae complex.},

Equal numbers of males and females were released in an enclosed  semi-field screenhouse system containing a range of local plants, but no host for  blood, and allowed to feed ad libitum: 6.7 +/- 0.5\% (11/64) of those recaptured  were found to contain detectable fructose (all females). Common plants are  clearly a viable source of nutrition for adult female An. gambiae, as well as  males, and may constitute and important resource for this important malaria  vector.},

	abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa has long suffered under the yoke of the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, but for northeast Brazil (figure 1) its arrival over 60 years ago was a  new and horrifying experience. This African mosquito is an exceptionally  effective malaria vector because it is well adapted to feeding upon people and to  exploiting aquatic habitats associated with our daily activities. Anopheles  gambiae sensu lato probably accounts for most of the world's malaria deaths and  socioeconomic burden. Fortunately, the Brazilian experience had a happy ending.  The prospect of A gambiae spreading across much of the Americas motivated a  ruthlessly effective response that deserves a special and heroic place in the  annals of public health. Building on the successes and infrastructure of the  Yellow Fever Service for Aedes aegypti elimination, the Rockefeller Foundation  and Brazilian government collaborated to form a new Malaria Service of the  Northeast. This new entity rolled the invader back into oblivion with an  aggressive eradication campaign, focusing primarily upon larviciding of all  potential habitats. The driving force of this endeavour was an enigmatic man  called Fred Soper whose sheer will and determination was a key element in this  success, and a source of inspiration today (see Killeen GF, et al. Eradication of  Anopheles gambiae from Brazil: lessons for malaria control in Africa? Lancet  Infect Dis 2002; 2: 618-27). I recently took an opportunity to fulfil a long-held  dream and follow in some of Soper's footsteps. Tired of gazing at yellowing maps  like figure 1, I went to see the northeast of Brazil for myself.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the population of Africa rapidly urbanizes it may be possible to protect large populations from malaria by controlling aquatic stages of  mosquitoes. Here we present a baseline evaluation of the ability of community  members to detect mosquito larval habitats with minimal training and supervision  in the first weeks of an operational urban malaria control program. METHODS: The  Urban Malaria Control Programme of Dar es Salaam recruited and provided  preliminary training to teams of Community-Owned Resource Persons (CORPs) who  performed weekly surveys of mosquito breeding sites. Two trained mosquito  biologists accompanied each of these teams for one week and evaluated the  sensitivity of this system for detecting potential Anopheles habitats. RESULTS:  Overall, 42.4\% of 986 habitats surveyed by an inspection team had previously been  identified by CORPs. Agricultural habitats were detected less often than other  habitats (30.8\% detected, Odds Ratio [95\%CI] = 0.46 [0.29-0.73], P = 0.001).  Non-agricultural artificial habitats were less suitable than other habitats  (29.3\% occupancy, OR = 0.69 [0.46-1.03], P = 0.066) but still constituted 45\%  (169/289) of occupied habitats because of their abundance (51 \% of all habitats).  CONCLUSION: The levels of coverage achieved by modestly trained and supported  CORPs at the start of the Dar es Salaam UMCP were insufficient to enable  effective suppression of malaria transmission through larval control. Further  operational research is required to develop surveillance systems that are  practical, affordable, effective and acceptable so that community-based  integrated vector management can be implemented in cities across Africa.},

Rigorous but affordable and scaleable methods for mapping and  managing mosquito habitats are required to enable effective larval control in  urban Africa. METHODS: A simple community-based mapping procedure that requires  no electronic devices in the field was developed to facilitate routine larval  surveillance in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The mapping procedure included (1)  community-based development of sketch maps and (2) verification of sketch maps  through technical teams using laminated aerial photographs in the field which  were later digitized and analysed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS).  RESULTS: Three urban wards of Dar es Salaam were comprehensively mapped, covering  an area of 16.8 km2. Over thirty percent of this area were not included in  preliminary community-based sketch mapping, mostly because they were areas that  do not appear on local government residential lists. The use of aerial  photographs and basic GIS allowed rapid identification and inclusion of these key  areas, as well as more equal distribution of the workload of malaria control  field staff. CONCLUSION: The procedure developed enables complete coverage of  targeted areas with larval control through comprehensive spatial coverage with  community-derived sketch maps. The procedure is practical, affordable, and  requires minimal technical skills. This approach can be readily integrated into  malaria vector control programmes, scaled up to towns and cities all over  Tanzania and adapted to urban settings elsewhere in Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost-sharing schemes incorporating modest targeted subsidies have promoted insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for malaria prevention in the Kilombero  Valley, southern Tanzania, since 1996. Here we evaluate resulting changes in  bednet coverage and malaria transmission. METHODS: Bednets were sold through  local agents at fixed prices representing a 34\% subsidy relative to full delivery  cost. A further targeted subsidy of 15\% was provided to vulnerable groups through  discount vouchers delivered through antenatal clinics and regular immunizations.  Continuous entomological surveys (2,376 trap nights) were conducted from October  2001 to September 2003 in 25 randomly-selected population clusters of a  demographic surveillance system which monitored net coverage. RESULTS: Mean net  usage of 75\% (11,982/16,086) across all age groups was achieved but now-obsolete  technologies available at the time resulted in low insecticide treatment rates.  Malaria transmission remained intense but was substantially reduced: Compared  with an exceptionally high historical mean EIR of 1481, even non-users of nets  were protected (EIR [fold reduction] = 349 infectious bites per person per year  [x4]), while the average resident (244 [x6]), users of typical nets (210 [x7])  and users of insecticidal nets (105 [x14]) enjoyed increasing benefits.  CONCLUSION: Despite low net treatment levels, community-level protection was  equivalent to the personal protection of an ITN. Greater gains for net users and  non-users are predicted if more expensive long-lasting ITN technologies can be  similarly promoted with correspondingly augmented subsidies. Cost sharing  strategies represent an important option for national programmes lacking adequate  financing to fully subsidize comprehensive ITN coverage.},

A latin square design was  applied for randomly assigning the treatment and control plants to experimental  houses over different nights. RESULTS: All plant species showed significant  repellency against Anopheles gambiae sensu lato Giles (Diptera: Culicidae)  (81.5\%An. arabiensis Patton and 18.5\%An. gambiae sensu stricto Giles), the main  vectors of malaria in Africa, with the highest repellency by C. citriodora  (48.71\%, P {\textless} 0.0001) followed by an equal level of repellency of O.  kilimandscharicum and O. suave (44.54\%, P = 0.001) during application of plant  material by thermal expulsion. All three plant species also showed a residual  effect against An. gambiae s.l. with 36-44\% repellency post-application period  (22.30-06.30 hours) after a period of thermal expulsion. Similarly, intact potted  plants of O. americanum and L. camara repelled An. gambiae s.l. significantly  (37.91\%, P = 0.004; and 27.22\%, P = 0.05, respectively). Thermal expulsion of  leaves and seeds of O. kilimandscharicum significantly repelled An. funestus  Giles, although none of the potted plants repelled this species. CONCLUSION: Both  methods of application may offer cost-effective alternatives as additional means  of household protection, and a useful complement to bed nets, particularly for  the early part of the evening before bedtime.},

Accordingly, antigens  of this critical insect organ are targets for anti-vector vaccines, insecticidal  toxins, and transmission-blocking vaccines. We used midgut proteins of the  African malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae to select single-chain human  antibody fragments (scFv) from a high-diversity, phage-displayed library. Using a  phage-display selection method on western-blotted antigens, we selected an  unusual truncated scFv clone, consisting of a heavy-chain only, which binds to  An. gambiae midgut tissue. This clone binds a spectrum of mosquito antigens from  the midgut and other mosquito tissues, as well as various mammalian  glycoproteins, but binding was reduced when these glycoproteins were  enzymatically deglycosylated. We also observed that this clone preferentially  binds the lumenal midgut surface. Furthermore, antigen binding by our selected  scFv was limited by competition with increasing concentrations of certain soluble  carbohydrates, most dramatically by galactose and N-acetyl glucosamine. Our  results show that the cognate epitope of this scFv is a carbohydrate moiety. This  paper describes a phage-display selection of antibody fragments on mosquito  midgut tissue and it also describes a method for phage-display selection on  membrane-immobilized heterogeneous antigens. These selection methods resulted in  the isolation of a novel, truncated, carbohydrate-binding human antibody fragment  from a naive phage-display library.},

Here we conducted a field study at Mbita, an  area of endemic malaria in Western Kenya, to test whether parasite transmission  to mosquitoes is influenced by the severity of malaria infection in its human  host at the time when gametocytes, the transmission forms, are present in the  peripheral blood. We examined the infectivity of 81 Plasmodium falciparum  gametocyte carriers to mosquitoes. Of these, 21 were patients with fever and  other malaria-related symptoms, and 60 were recruited among apparently healthy  volunteers. Laboratory-reared Anopheles gambiae s.s. (local strain) were  experimentally infected with blood from these gametocyte carriers by  membrane-feeding. The severity of the clinical symptoms was greater in febrile  patients. These symptomatic patients had higher asexual parasitaemia and lower  gametocyte densities (P = 0.05) than healthy volunteers. Ookinete development  occurred in only 6 out of the 21 symptomatic patients, of which only 33.3\%  successfully yielded oocysts. The oocyst prevalence was only 0.6\% in the 546  mosquitoes that were fed on blood from this symptomatic group, with mean oocyst  intensity of 0.2 (range 0-2) oocysts per mosquito. In contrast, a higher  proportion (76.7\%) of healthy gametocyte carriers yielded ookinetes, generating  an oocyst rate of 12\% in the 1332 mosquitoes that fed on them (mean intensity of  6.3, range: 1-105 oocysts per mosquito). Statistical analysis indicated that the  increased infectivity of asymptomatic gametocyte carriers was not simply due to  their greater gametocyte abundance, but also to the higher level of infectivity  of their gametocytes, possibly due to lower parasite mortality within mosquitoes  fed on blood from healthy hosts. These results suggest that blood factors and/or  conditions correlated with illness reduce P. falciparum gametocyte infectivity.},

Five rounds of  panning yielded only one midgut-specific clone, which predominated the resulting  antibody panel. In A. gambiae, the epitope was found throughout the tissues of  females but was absent from the midgut of males. The cognate antigen proved to be  detergent soluble but very sensitive to denaturation and could not be isolated or  identified by Western blot of native electrophoresis gels or by  immunoprecipitation. Nevertheless, immunohistology revealed that this  sex-specific epitope is associated with the lumenal side of the midgut. Severe  bottlenecking may limit the utility of phage display selection from naïve  libraries for generating diverse panels of antibodies against complex mixtures of  antigens from insect tissues.

(17.9\%), Tagetes minuta L. (11.3\%) and Azadirachta indica A. Juss (8.7\%) on  Rusinga Island, and Hyptis suaveolens Poit. (49.2\%), L. camara (30.9\%) and O.  basilicum L. (30.4\%) in Rambira. Direct burning of plants is the most common  method of application for O. americanum (68.8\%), L. camara (100\%) and O.  basilicum (58.8\%). Placing branches or whole plants inside houses is most common  for H. suaveolens (33.3 and 57.8\% for the respective locations), A. indica (66.7  and 100\%), and T. minuta (54.8 and 56.0\%). The repellency of plants suggested by  the ethnobotanical survey and other empirical information was evaluated against  the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s.s. Giles in experimental huts within a  screenwalled greenhouse. Thermal expulsion and direct burning were tested as  alternative application methods for the selected plants O. americanum, O.  kilimandscharicum Guerke, O. suave Willd., L. camara, A. indica, H. suaveolens,  Lippia uckambensis Spreng and Corymbia citriodora Hook. When thermally expelled,  only H. suaveolens failed to repel mosquitoes, whereas the leaves of C.  citriodora (74.5\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), leaves and seeds of O. suave (53.1\%, P {\textless} 0.0001)  and O. kilimandscharicum (52.0\%, P {\textless} 0.0001) were the most effective. Leaves of  C. citriodora also exhibited the highest repellency (51.3\%, P {\textless} 0.0001) by direct  burning, followed by leaves of L. uckambensis (33.4\%, P = 0.0004) and leaves and  seeds of O. suave (28.0\%, P = 0.0255). The combination of O. kilimandscharicum  with L. uckambensis repelled 54.8\% of mosquitoes (P {\textless} 0.0001) by thermal  expulsion. No combination of plants increased repellency by either method. The  semi-field system described appears a promising alternative to full-field trials  for screening large numbers of candidate repellents without risk of malaria  exposure.},

Ammonia was determined by use of an ion-selective  electrode, by L-glutamate dehydrogenase (L-GDH), and by two different Berthelot  procedures, in the presence and absence of oxystarch. In the presence of total  oxystarch the Berthelot method, particularly when low concentration reagents were  used, detected significantly less (P {\textless} 0.10) free ammonia than either L-GDH or  ion-selective electrode methods. A 0.5-kDa molecular weight cutoff sample  ultrafiltration step was added prior to analysis by L-GDH and Berthelot  procedures. To facilitate complete removal of oxystarch by the ultrafiltration  step, oxystarch was dialyzed before use, yielding a high-molecular-weight  fraction ({\textgreater} 1 kDa). Removal of high-molecular-weight oxystarch species and bound  ammonia by ultrafiltration of samples prior to assay completely negated  discrepancies between ammonia levels measured by L-GDH and both Berthelot  methods. The correlation of the levels of measured ammonia, as determined by  L-GDH and Berthelot methods, in mixtures with high-molecular-weight oxystarch was  significantly improved by the addition of the sample ultrafiltration step.  Improved correlation of results from such fundamentally different methods  demonstrates the removal of interfering agents as well as the nonperturbatory  nature of the improved procedure. The addition of such an ultrafiltration step  may be applied to the determination of ammonia by the otherwise  interference-prone Berthelot assay in mixtures with any interfering  macromolecules, without the inconvenience or potential variabilities associated  with distillation or diffusion procedures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on sensitivity analysis of the MacDonald-Ross model, it has long been argued that the best way to reduce malaria transmission is to target  adult female mosquitoes with insecticides that can reduce the longevity and  human-feeding frequency of vectors. However, these analyses have ignored a  fundamental biological difference between mosquito adults and the immature stages  that precede them: adults are highly mobile flying insects that can readily  detect and avoid many intervention measures whereas mosquito eggs, larvae and  pupae are confined within relatively small aquatic habitats and cannot readily  escape control measures. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that the  control of adult but not immature mosquitoes is compromised by their ability to  avoid interventions such as excito-repellant insecticides. TESTING THE  HYPOTHESIS: We apply a simple model of intervention avoidance by mosquitoes and  demonstrate that this can substantially reduce effective coverage, in terms of  the proportion of the vector population that is covered, and overall impact on  malaria transmission. We review historical evidence that larval control of  African malaria vectors can be effective and conclude that the only limitations  to the effective coverage of larval control are practical rather than  fundamental. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Larval control strategies against  the vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa could be highly effective,  complementary to adult control interventions, and should be prioritized for  further development, evaluation and implementation as an integral part of Rolling  Back Malaria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes sampling is an important component in malaria control. However, most of the methods used have several shortcomings and hence there is a  need to develop and calibrate new methods. The Mbita trap for capturing  host-seeking mosquitoes was recently developed and successfully tested in Kenya.  However, the Mbita trap is less effective at catching outdoor-biting Anopheles  funestus and Anopheles arabiensis in Madagascar and, thus, there is need to  further evaluate this trap in diverse epidemiological settings. This study  reports a field evaluation of the Mbita trap in a rice irrigation scheme in Kenya  METHODS: The mosquito sampling efficiency of the Mbita trap was compared to that  of the CDC light trap and the human landing catch in western Kenya. Data was  analysed by Bayesian regression of linear and non-linear models. RESULTS: The  Mbita trap caught about 17\%, 60\%, and 20\% of the number of An. arabiensis, An.  funestus, and culicine species caught in the human landing collections  respectively. There was consistency in sampling proportionality between the Mbita  trap and the human landing catch for both An. arabiensis and the culicine  species. For An. funestus, the Mbita trap portrayed some density-dependent  sampling efficiency that suggested lowered sampling efficiency of human landing  catch at low densities. The CDC light trap caught about 60\%, 120\%, and 552\% of  the number of An. arabiensis, An. funestus, and culicine species caught in the  human landing collections respectively. There was consistency in the sampling  proportionality between the CDC light trap and the human landing catch for both  An. arabiensis and An. funestus, whereas for the culicines, there was no simple  relationship between the two methods. CONCLUSIONS: The Mbita trap is less  sensitive than either the human landing catch or the CDC light trap. However, for  a given investment of time and money, it is likely to catch more mosquitoes over  a longer (and hence more representative) period. This trap can therefore be  recommended for use by community members for passive mosquito surveillance.  Nonetheless, there is still a need to develop new sampling methods for some  epidemiological settings. The human landing catch should be maintained as the  standard reference method for use in calibrating new methods for sampling the  human biting population of mosquitoes.},

	abstract = {A cross-sectional survey of agricultural areas, combined with routinely monitored mosquito larval information, was conducted in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to  investigate how agricultural and geographical features may influence the presence  of Anopheles larvae. Data were integrated into a geographical information systems  framework, and predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in farming areas  were assessed using multivariate logistic regression with independent random  effects. It was found that more than 5\% of the study area (total size 16.8 km2)  was used for farming in backyard gardens and larger open spaces. The proportion  of habitats containing Anopheles larvae was 1.7 times higher in agricultural  areas compared to other areas (95\% confidence interval = 1.56-1.92). Significant  geographic predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in gardens included  location in lowland areas, proximity to river, and relatively impermeable soils.  Agriculture-related predictors comprised specific seedbed types, mid-sized  gardens, irrigation by wells, as well as cultivation of sugar cane or leafy  vegetables. Negative predictors included small garden size, irrigation by tap  water, rainfed production and cultivation of leguminous crops or fruit trees.  Although there was an increased chance of finding Anopheles larvae in  agricultural sites, it was found that breeding sites originated by urban  agriculture account for less than a fifth of all breeding sites of malaria  vectors in Dar es Salaam. It is suggested that strategies comprising an  integrated malaria control effort in malaria-endemic African cities include  participatory involvement of farmers by planting shade trees near larval  habitats.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human landing catch (HLC) is the gold standard method for sampling host-seeking malaria vectors. However, the HLC is ethically questionable  because it requires exposure of humans to potentially infectious mosquito bites.  METHODS: Two exposure-free methods for sampling host-seeking mosquitoes were  evaluated using electrocuting surfaces as potential replacements for HLC: (1) a  previously evaluated, commercially available electrocuting grid (CA-EG) designed  for killing flies, and (2) a custom-made mosquito electrocuting trap (MET)  designed to kill African malaria vectors. The MET and the CA-EG were evaluated  relative to the HLC in a Latin Square experiment conducted in the Kilombero  Valley, Tanzania. The sampling consistency of the traps across the night and at  varying mosquito densities was investigated. Estimates of the proportion of  mosquitoes caught indoors (P(i)), proportion of human exposure occurring indoors  (π(i)), and proportion of mosquitoes caught when most people are likely to be  indoors (P(fl)) were compared for all traps. RESULTS: Whereas the CA-EG performed  poorly ({\textless}10\% of catch of HLC), sampling efficiency of the MET for sampling  Anopheles funestus s.l. was indistinguishable from HLC indoors and outdoors. For  Anopheles gambiae s.l., sampling sensitivity of MET was 20.9\% (95\% CI 10.3-42.2)  indoors and 58.5\% (95\% CI 32.2-106.2) outdoors relative to HLC. There was no  evidence of density-dependent sampling by the MET or CA-EG. Similar estimates of  P(i) were obtained for An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus s.l. from all trapping  methods. The proportion of mosquitoes caught when people are usually indoors  (P(fl)) was underestimated by the CA-EG and MET for An. gambiae s.l., but similar  to the HLC for An. funestus. Estimates of the proportion of human exposure  occurring indoors (π(i)) obtained from the CA-EG and MET were similar to the HLC  for An. gambiae s.l., but overestimated for An. funestus. CONCLUSIONS: The MET  showed promise as an outdoor sampling tool for malaria vectors where it achieved  {\textgreater}50\% sampling sensitivity relative to the HLC. The CA-EG had poor sampling  sensitivity outdoors and inside. With further modification, the MET could provide  an efficient and safer alternative to the HLC for the surveillance of mosquito  vectors outdoors.},

Possible use of the BG Sentinel  (BGS) trap to sample Anopheles gambiae s.s. was evaluated. The efficiency of this  trap was compared with that of the Mosquito Magnet-X (MM-X) trap, when baited  with foot odour alone or combinations of foot odour with carbon dioxide (CO2) or  lemongrass as behaviour-modifying cues. METHODS: Female An. gambiae s.s. were  released in an experimental flight arena that was placed in a semi-field system  and left overnight. Catch rates for the MM-X and BGS traps were recorded. Data  were analysed by fitting a generalized linear model to the (n+1) transformed  catches. RESULTS: Both types of traps successfully captured mosquitoes with all  odour cues used. When the BGS trap was tested against the MM-X trap in a choice  assay with foot odour as bait, the BGS trap caught about three times as many  mosquitoes as the MM-X trap (P = 0.002). Adding CO2 (500 ml/min) to foot odour  increased the number of mosquitoes caught by 268\% for the MM-X (P {\textless} 0.001) and  34\% (P = 0.051) for the BGS trap, compared to foot odour alone. When lemongrass  leaves were added to foot odour, mosquito catches were reduced by 39\% (BGS, P {\textless}  0.001) and 38\% (MM-X, P = 0.353), respectively. CONCLUSION: The BGS trap shows  high potential for field trials due to its simple construction and high catch  rate when baited with human foot odour only. However, for rapid screening of  different baits in a contained semi-field system, the superior discriminatory  power of the MM-X trap is advantageous.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tanzania has a well-developed network of commercial ITN retailers. In 2004, the government introduced a voucher subsidy for pregnant women and, in mid  2005, helped distribute free nets to under-fives in small number of districts,  including Rufiji on the southern coast, during a child health campaign.  Contributions of these multiple insecticide-treated net delivery strategies  existing at the same time and place to coverage in a poor rural community were  assessed. METHODS: Cross-sectional household survey in 6,331 members of randomly  selected 1,752 households of 31 rural villages of Demographic Surveillance System  in Rufiji district, Southern Tanzania was conducted in 2006. A questionnaire was  administered to every consenting respondent about net use, treatment status and  delivery mechanism. FINDINGS: Net use was 62.7\% overall, 87.2\% amongst infants (0  to 1 year), 81.8\% amongst young children ({\textgreater}1 to 5 years), 54.5\% amongst older  children (6 to 15 years) and 59.6\% amongst adults ({\textgreater}15 years). 30.2\% of all nets  had been treated six months prior to interview. The biggest source of nets used  by infants was purchase from the private sector with a voucher subsidy (41.8\%).  Half of nets used by young children (50.0\%) and over a third of those used by  older children (37.2\%) were obtained free of charge through the vaccination  campaign. The largest source of nets amongst the population overall was  commercial purchase (45.1\% use) and was the primary means for protecting adults  (60.2\% use). All delivery mechanisms, especially sale of nets at full market  price, under-served the poorest but no difference in equity was observed between  voucher-subsidized and freely distributed nets. CONCLUSION: All three delivery  strategies enabled a poor rural community to achieve net coverage high enough to  yield both personal and community level protection for the entire population.  Each of them reached their relevant target group and free nets only temporarily  suppressed the net market, illustrating that in this setting that these are  complementary rather than mutually exclusive approaches.},

Anopheles gambiae dynamics were monitored  over a six-month period of seasonal growth and decline. The population exhibited  density-dependent feedback, with the carrying capacity being modified by rainfall  (97\% wAIC(c) support). The individual phenotypic expression of the maternal (p =  0.0001) and current (p = 0.040) body size positively influenced population  growth. Our field-based evidence uniquely demonstrates that individual fitness  can have population-level impacts and, furthermore, can mitigate the impact of  exogenous drivers (e.g. rainfall) in species whose reproduction depends upon it.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for treating malaria has activity against immature gametocytes. In theory, this property may complement  the effect of terminating otherwise lengthy malaria infections and reducing the  parasite reservoir in the human population that can infect vector mosquitoes.  However, this has never been verified at a population level in a setting with  intense transmission, where chronically infectious asymptomatic carriers are  common and cured patients are rapidly and repeatedly re-infected. METHODS: From  2001 to 2004, malaria vector densities were monitored using light traps in three  Tanzanian districts. Mosquitoes were dissected to determine parous and oocyst  rates. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rates were determined by ELISA.  Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) monotherapy was used for treatment of  uncomplicated malaria in the contiguous districts of Kilombero and Ulanga  throughout this period. In Rufiji district, the standard drug was changed to  artesunate co-administered with SP (AS + SP) in March 2003. The effects of this  change in case management on malaria parasite infection in the vectors were  analysed. RESULTS: Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rates exceeded  300 infective bites per person per year at both sites over the whole period. The  introduction of AS + SP in Rufiji was associated with increased oocyst prevalence  (OR [95\%CI] = 3.9 [2.9-5.3], p {\textless} 0.001), but had no consistent effect on  sporozoite prevalence (OR [95\%CI] = 0.9 [0.7-1.2], p = 0.5). The estimated  infectiousness of the human population in Rufiji was very low prior to the change  in drug policy. Emergence rates and parous rates of the vectors varied  substantially throughout the study period, which affected estimates of  infectiousness. The latter consequently cannot be explained by the change in drug  policy. CONCLUSIONS: In high perennial transmission settings, only a small  proportion of infections in humans are symptomatic or treated, so case management  with ACT may have little impact on overall infectiousness of the human  population. Variations in infection levels in vectors largely depend on the age  distribution of the mosquito population. Benefits of ACT in suppressing  transmission are more likely to be evident where transmission is already low or  effective vector control is widely implemented.},

In this  study, we report further on the accuracy of this tool for simultaneously  estimating the age class and differentiating the morphologically  indistinguishable An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis from semi-field releases  and wild populations. Nine different ages (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 d) of  An. arabiensis and eight different ages (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 d) of An.  gambiae s.s. maintained in 250 x 60 x 40 cm cages within a semi-field large-cage  system and 105 wild-caught female An. gambiae s.l., were included in this study.  NIRS classified female An. arabiensis and An. gambiae s.s. maintained in  semi-field cages as /=7 d old with 89\% (n = 377) and 78\% (n = 327)  accuracy, respectively, and differentiated them with 89\% (n = 704) accuracy. Wild  caught An. gambiae s.l. were identified with 90\% accuracy (n = 105) whereas their  predicted ages were consistent with the expected mean chronological ages of the  physiological age categories determined by dissections. These findings have  importance for monitoring control programmes where reduction in the proportion of  older mosquitoes that have the ability to transmit malaria is an important  outcome.},

	abstract = {Poverty reduction policies guide development strategies. In economies that depend heavily on agriculture, in the face of rapid population growth, innovative  approaches are required to satisfy food needs, increase household welfare and  alleviate poverty. Irrigated agriculture is an important strategy to enhance crop  production, but it must be well tailored to specific socio-ecological settings,  as otherwise, it might increase the burden of water-related parasitic diseases  and delay economic advance. The purpose of this study is to assess and quantify  the effect of ill health, particularly malaria, on the performance of farm  activity, with an emphasis on drip-irrigated vegetable farming in rural Côte  d'Ivoire. Vegetable yields and revenues were monitored among 12 farmers and  linked with longitudinal medical and entomological surveys. Over the course of 10  months, farmers were classified as sick, on average, for 14-15 days, with malaria  accounting for 8-9 days (58\%), confirming that malaria is the most important  disease in this setting. There was a large heterogeneity among farmers, with  malaria-related work losses ranging between 0 and 26 days. Work absenteeism  correlated with overall yields and revenues. During a single cabbage production  cycle, those farmers who were prescribed sick because of malaria for more than 2  days (mean: 4.2 days) had 47\% lower yields and 53\% lower revenues than farmers  who missed a maximum of 2 days (mean: 0.3 days). This is consequential in an  intensive cropping system, where substitutes for qualified workers are not  readily available. We conclude that mitigating the burden of malaria is an  important step towards reducing the vulnerability of people engaged in intensive  agricultural production. This calls for targeted interventions to facilitate  agriculture-based rural development that might spur social and economic  development and reduce inequities in sub-Saharan Africa.},

Its mosquito sampling efficiency was compared to  the CDC miniature light-trap and human landing catches under semi-field  conditions in a screen-walled greenhouse using laboratory-reared Anopheles  gambiae Giles sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae). When compared in a competitive  manner (side by side), the Mbita trap caught 4.1+/-0.5 times as many mosquitoes  as the CDC light-trap, hung beside an occupied bednet (P {\textless} 0.000 1) and  43.2+/-10\% the number caught by human landing catches (P {\textless} 0.0001). The ratio of  Mbita trap catches to those of the CDC light trap increased with decreasing  mosquito density. Mosquito density did not affect the ratio of Mbita trap to  human-landing catches. In a non-competitive comparison (each method independent  of the other), the Mbita trap caught 89.7+/-10\% the number of mosquitoes caught  by human landing catches (P {\textless} 0.0001) and 1.2+/-0.1 times more mosquitoes than  the CDC light trap (P = 0.0008). Differences in Mbita trap performance relative  to the human landing catch under noncompetitive vs. competitive conditions were  explained by the rate at which each method captured mosquitoes. Such bednet traps  do not expose people to potentially infectious mosquito bites and operate  passively all night without the need for skilled personnel. This trap is  specifically designed to catch host-seeking mosquitoes only and may be an  effective, sensitive, user-friendly and economic alternative to existing methods  for mosquito surveillance in Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community participation in vector control and health services in general is of great interest to public health practitioners in developing  countries, but remains complex and poorly understood. The Urban Malaria Control  Program (UMCP) in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania, implements larval  control of malaria vector mosquitoes. The UMCP delegates responsibility for  routine mosquito control and surveillance to community-owned resource persons  (CORPs), recruited from within local communities via the elected local  government. METHODS: A mixed method, cross-sectional survey assessed the ability  of CORPs to detect mosquito breeding sites and larvae, and investigated  demographic characteristics of the CORPs, their reasons for participating in the  UMCP, and their work performance. Detection coverage was estimated as the  proportion of wet habitats found by the investigator which had been reported by  CORP. Detection sensitivity was estimated as the proportion of wet habitats found  by the CORPS which the investigator found to contain Anopheles larvae that were  also reported to be occupied by the CORP. RESULTS: The CORPs themselves perceived  their role as professional rather than voluntary, with participation being a de  facto form of employment. Habitat detection coverage was lower among CORPs that  were recruited through the program administrative staff, compared to CORPs  recruited by local government officials or health committees (Odds Ratio = 0.660,  95\% confidence interval = [0.438, 0.995], P = 0.047). Staff living within their  areas of responsibility had {\textgreater} 70\% higher detection sensitivity for both  Anopheline (P = 0.016) and Culicine (P = 0.012): positive habitats compared to  those living outside those same areas. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Improved  employment conditions as well as involving the local health committees in  recruiting individual program staff, communication and community engagement  skills are required to optimize achieving effective community participation,  particularly to improve access to fenced compounds. A simpler, more direct, less  extensive community-based surveillance system in the hands of a few, less  burdened, better paid and maintained program personnel may improve performance  and data quality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimentally studying the transmission of the malaria parasite and its regulating factors requires availability of human blood donors carrying  infectious gametocytes. The difficulty of identifying gametocyte carriers from  the community is often limited due to financial and human resources constraints.  The available alternative is rural health centres where malaria patients go for  treatment. In this study, the potential of recruiting volunteers and acquiring  infectious blood for experimental infections from rural health centers in malaria  endemic area was examined through routine patient diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To  examine the patients presenting at rural health centers for the potential to  carry sexual stage malaria parasite and test their infectivity to Anopheles  gambiae mosquitoes. SETTING: Mbita Health Centre, Mbita Town Ship, Suba District,  western Kenya. METHODOLOGY: Routine survey of all patients attending Mbita Health  Centre with suspected malaria. Patients were examined for Plasmodium falciparum  trophozoites and gametocytes. Gametocyte-positive volunteers were recruited for  their potential to infect Anopheles mosquitoes via membrane feeding. RESULTS:  Three thousand nine hundred and eighty seven patients were screened between May  2000 and April 2001. Plasmodium falciparum was the predominant parasite species  and P. malariae being the only minor species, accounting for 0.9\% of malaria  cases. Clinical malaria varied with age and prevailed throughout the year with a  slight seasonality. Gametocyte prevalence was low (0.9-6.6\%), and gametocyte  densities were generally very low with a geometric mean of 39 gametocytes per  microl blood. Children aged {\textgreater} 5 years constituted 67\% of all gametocyte carriers.  Only 22 volunteers with mean gametocytes density of 39.62 per microl blood  (range: 16-112) were recruited for study of parasite infectiousness to  laboratory-reared mosquitoes. Only two patients infected 1\% of 1099 mosquitoes  with one or two oocysts. CONCLUSION: The low gametocyte densities or other  possible host and vector related factors regulating infectivity of gametocyte  carriers to mosquitoes may have caused the poor infections of mosquitoes. This  study indicates that rural health centers in malaria-endemic areas may not be  suitable for recruiting infectious gametocyte donors for studies of vector  competence. They are suitable for passive clinical case surveillance and for  evaluation of the effects of control measures.},

We then  fit an exponential decay model to repeated cross-sectional survey data collected  from three historical trials of indoor residual spraying against malaria: one  from two contiguous districts in Tanzania-Kenya (Pare Taveta) carried out in  1954, the others in West Papua (1953), and the Garki project in northern Nigeria  (1972-1973). A cross-sectional analysis of these datasets gave overall estimates  of 602 days (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 581-625) for the infection duration  in Pare Taveta, 734 days (95\% CI = 645-849) in West Papua, and 1,329 days (95\% CI  =1,193-1,499) for Garki. These estimates are much greater than the most widely  quoted figures for the duration of untreated P. falciparum infections. Although  these may be exaggerated because some reinfections occurred despite intensive  vector control, prevalence was still decreasing when all these projects ended.  Longitudinal survival analysis of the Garki data gave much shorter estimates of  duration (186 days, 95\% CI = 181-191), but effects of imperfect detection of  parasites by microscopy severely bias these estimates. Estimates of infection  duration for different age groups showed considerable variation but no general  age trend. There was also no clear relationship between malaria endemicity and  infection duration. Analyses of successive sampling from the same individuals  with parasite typing are needed to obtain more reliable estimates of infection  duration in endemic areas. Periods of several years may be required to evaluate  long-term effects of interventions on malaria prevalence.},

As a complement to treated nets and prompt access to  treatment, measures targeted against the larval stage of Anopheles sp. mosquitoes  are a promising strategy for urban areas. However, a precise knowledge of the  geographic location and potentially of ecological characteristics of breeding  sites is of major importance for such interventions. METHODS: In total 151 km2 of  central Dar es Salaam, the biggest city of Tanzania, were systematically searched  for open mosquito breeding sites. Ecologic parameters, mosquito larvae density  and geographic location were recorded for each site. Logistic regression analysis  was used to determine the key ecological factors explaining the different  densities of mosquito larvae. RESULTS: A total of 405 potential open breeding  sites were examined. Large drains, swamps and puddles were associated with no or  low Anopheles sp. larvae density. The probability of Anopheles sp. larvae to be  present was reduced when water was identified as "turbid". Small breeding sites  were more commonly colonized by Anopheles sp. larvae. Further, Anopheles gambiae  s.l. larvae were found in highly organically polluted habitats. CONCLUSIONS:  Clear ecological characteristics of the breeding requirements of Anopheles sp.  larvae could not be identified in this setting. Hence, every stagnant open water  body, including very polluted ones, have to be considered as potential malaria  vector breeding sites.},

An improved C model (ITT-C) was  developed and evaluated by comparing with ITT-B in semi-field and full-field  conditions in southern Tanzania.

Overall, the Mbita trap caught 48.7 +/- 4.8\% (mean +/- SEM) the number of  Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu lato caught in the human landing catch and 27.4 +/-  8.2\% of the number caught by the light trap. The corresponding figures for  Anopheles funestus Giles were 74.6 +/- 1.3\% and 39.2 +/- 1.9\%, respectively.  Despite the clear differences in the numbers of mosquitoes caught by each method,  both the Mbita trap and light trap catches were directly proportional to human  landing catches regardless of mosquito density. No significant differences in  parity or sporozoite incidence were observed between mosquitoes caught by the  three methods for either An. gambiae s.l. or An. funestus. Identification of the  sibling species of the An. gambiae complex by a polymerase chain reaction  indicated that the ratio of An. gambiae Giles sensu stricto to An. arabiensis  Patton did not vary according to the sampling method used. It is concluded that  the Mbita trap is a promising tool for sampling malaria vector populations since  its catch can be readily converted into equivalent human biting catch, it can be  applied more intensively, it requires neither expensive equipment nor skilled  personnel, and it samples mosquitoes in an exposure-free manner. Such intensive  sampling capability will allow cost-effective surveillance of malaria  transmission at much finer spatial and temporal resolution than has been  previously possible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium-refractory mosquitoes are being rapidly developed for malaria control but will only succeed if they can successfully compete for mates  when released into the wild. Pre-copulatory behavioural traits maintain genetic  population structure in wild mosquito populations and mating barriers have foiled  previous attempts to control malaria vectors through sterile male release.  METHODS: Varying numbers of virgin male and female Anopheles gambiae Giles, from  two strains of different innate sizes, were allowed to mate under standardized  conditions in laboratory cages, following which, the insemination status,  oviposition success and egg batch size of each female was assessed. The influence  of male and female numbers, strain combination and female size were determined  using logistic regression, correlation analysis and a simple mechanistic model of  male competition for females. RESULTS: Male An. gambiae select females on the  basis of size because of much greater fecundity among large females. Even under  conditions where large numbers of males must compete for a smaller number of  females, the largest females are more likely to become inseminated, to  successfully oviposit and to produce large egg batches. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual  selection, on the basis of size, could either promote or limit the spread of  malaria-refractory genes into wild populations and needs to be considered in the  continued development and eventual release of transgenic vectors. Fundamental  studies of behavioural ecology in malaria vectors such as An. gambiae can have  important implications for malaria control and should be prioritised for more  extensive investigation in the future.},

Here, we present a patch-based differential equation modeling framework that extends the Ross-Macdonald model with sufficient skill and complexity to support planning, monitoring and evaluation for Plasmodium falciparum malaria control. We designed a generic interface for building structured, spatial models of malaria transmission based on a new algorithm for mosquito blood feeding. We developed new algorithms to simulate adult mosquito demography, dispersal, and egg laying in response to resource availability. The core dynamical components describing mosquito ecology and malaria transmission were decomposed, redesigned and reassembled into a modular framework. Structural elements in the framework—human population strata, patches, and aquatic habitats—interact through a flexible design that facilitates construction of ensembles of models with scalable complexity to support robust analytics for malaria policy and adaptive malaria control. We propose updated definitions for the human biting rate and entomological inoculation rates. We present new formulas to describe parasite dispersal and spatial dynamics under steady state conditions, including the human biting rates, parasite dispersal, the “vectorial capacity matrix,” a human transmitting capacity distribution matrix, and threshold conditions. An R package that implements the framework, solves the differential equations, and computes spatial metrics for models developed in this framework has been developed. Development of the model and metrics have focused on malaria, but since the framework is modular, the same ideas and software can be applied to other mosquito-borne pathogen systems.},

The nature of the sites used for this field work is crucial to ensure that a trial can feasibly collect sufficient and relevant information, given the available resources and practical limitations, and having secured the correct regulatory, community and ethical approvals and support. Mauritius is considering the inclusion of the sterile insect technique (SIT), for population reduction of Aedes albopictus, as a component of the Ministry of Health and Quality of Life's ‘Operational Plan for Prevention and Control of Chikungunya and Dengue‘. As part of an investigation into the feasibility of integrating the SIT into the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) scheme in Mauritius a pilot trial is planned. Two potential sites have been selected for this purpose, Pointe des Lascars and Panchvati, villages in the North East of the country, and population surveillance has commenced. This case study will here be used to explore the considerations which go into determining the most appropriate sites for mosquito field research. Although each situation is unique, and an ideal site may not be available, this discussion aims to help researchers to consider and balance the important factors and select field sites that will meet their needs.},

However, field studies addressing the interplay of weather factors on oviposition dynamics at the intermediate (days to weeks) time scale are missing. Here, we present the results from a field study that showed the oviposition dynamics of the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), to be: (i) primarily dictated by relative humidity; and (ii) disrupted by rainfall events that resulted in a modified sensitivity to relative humidity. Rainfall changed the concentration of ammonia, a major limiting resource of microbes used as food by mosquito larvae. Following major rainfall events, the importance of relative humidity in forcing the oviposition dynamics also changed. Finally, our results indicate that qualitative changes in oviposition habitats modify the importance of weather variables as predictors of mosquito oviposition dynamics.},

Climate adaptation may be particularly likely for short-lived ectotherms, including many pest, pathogen, and vector species. For these taxa, estimating climate adaptive potential is critical for accurate predictive modeling and public health preparedness. Here, we demonstrate how a simple theoretical framework used in conservation biology—evolutionary rescue models—can be used to investigate the potential for climate adaptation in these taxa, using mosquito thermal adaptation as a focal case. Synthesizing current evidence, we find that short mosquito generation times, high population growth rates, and strong temperature-imposed selection favor thermal adaptation. However, knowledge gaps about the extent of phenotypic and genotypic variation in thermal tolerance within mosquito populations, the environmental sensitivity of selection, and the role of phenotypic plasticity constrain our ability to make more precise estimates. We describe how common garden and selection experiments can be used to fill these data gaps. Lastly, we investigate the consequences of mosquito climate adaptation on disease transmission using Aedes aegypti-transmitted dengue virus in Northern Brazil as a case study. The approach outlined here can be applied to any disease vector or pest species and type of environmental change.},

Arthropod vectors experience a complex suite of environmental factors that affect fitness, population growth and species interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Temperature and water availability are two of the most important abiotic variables influencing their distributions and abundances. While extensive research on temperature exists, the influence of humidity on vector and pathogen parameters affecting disease dynamics are less understood. Humidity is often underemphasized, and when considered, is often treated as independent of temperature even though desiccation likely contributes to declines in trait performance at warmer temperatures. This Perspectives explores how humidity shapes the thermal performance of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. We summarize what is known about its effects and propose a conceptual model for how temperature and humidity interact to shape the range of temperatures across which mosquitoes persist and achieve high transmission potential. We discuss how failing to account for these interactions hinders efforts to forecast transmission dynamics and respond to epidemics of mosquito-borne infections. We outline future research areas that will ground the effects of humidity on the thermal biology of pathogen transmission in a theoretical and empirical framework to improve spatial and temporal prediction of vector-borne pathogen transmission.},

Classical coupled vector–human models typically assume that mosquito abundance is either independent from, or proportional to, human population density, implying a decreasing force of infection, or per capita infection rate with host number. We question these assumptions by introducing an explicit dependence between host and vector densities through different recruitment functions, whose dynamical consequences we examine in a modified model formulation. Contrasting patterns in the force of infection are demonstrated, including in particular increasing trends when recruitment grows sufficiently fast with human density. Interaction of these patterns with seasonality in temperature can give rise to pronounced differences in timing, relative peak sizes, and duration of epidemics. These proposed dependencies explain empirical dengue risk patterns observed in the city of Delhi where socio-economic status has an impact on both human and mosquito densities. These observed risk trends with host density are inconsistent with current standard models. A better understanding of the connection between vector recruitment and host density is needed to address the population dynamics of mosquito-transmitted infections in urban landscapes.},

Members of the Aedes and Culex genera, which include many important vectors of mosquito-borne diseases, are highly invasive and adapted to man-made environments. They are spread around the world involuntarily by humans and are highly adapted to urbanized environments, where they are exposed to climate-related abundance drivers. We investigated Culicidae fauna in two urban parks in the city of São Paulo to analyze the correlations between climatic variables and the population dynamics of mosquitoes in these urban areas. Mosquitoes were collected monthly over one year, and sampling sufficiency was evaluated after morphological identification of the specimens. The average monthly temperature and accumulated rainfall for the collection month and previous month were used to explain climate-related abundance drivers for the six most abundant species (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Aedes fluviatilis, Aedes scapularis, Culex nigripalpus and Culex quinquefasciatus) and then analyzed using generalized linear statistical models and the Akaike Information Criteria corrected for small samples (AICc). The strength of evidence in favor of each model was evaluated using Akaike weights, and the explanatory model power was measured by McFadden's Pseudo-R2. Associations between climate and mosquito abundance were found in both parks, indicating that predictive models based on climate variables can provide important information on mosquito population dynamics. We also found that this association is species-dependent. Urbanization processes increase the abundance of a few mosquito species that are well adapted to man-made environments and some of which are important vectors of pathogens. Predictive models for abundance based on climate variables may help elucidate the population dynamics of urban mosquitoes and their impact on the risk of disease transmission, allowing better predictive scenarios to be developed and supporting the implementation of vector mosquito control strategies.},

	abstract = {As malaria declines in many African countries there is a growing realization that new interventions need to be added to the front-line vector control tools of long-lasting impregnated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) that target adult mosquitoes indoors. Larval source management (LSM) provides the dual benefits of not only reducing numbers of house-entering mosquitoes, but, importantly, also those that bite outdoors. Large-scale LSM was a highly effective method of malaria control in the first half of the twentieth century, but was largely disbanded in favour of IRS with DDT. Today LSM continues to be used in large-scale mosquito abatement programmes in North America and Europe, but has only recently been tested in a few trials of malaria control in contemporary Africa. The results from these trials show that hand-application of larvicides can reduce transmission by 70-90\% in settings where mosquito larval habitats are defined but is largely ineffectual where habitats are so extensive that not all of them can be covered on foot, such as areas that experience substantial flooding. Importantly recent evidence shows that LSM can be an effective method of malaria control, especially when combined with LLINs. Nevertheless, there are a number of misconceptions or even myths that hamper the advocacy for LSM by leading international institutions and the uptake of LSM by Malaria Control Programmes. Many argue that LSM is not feasible in Africa due to the high number of small and temporary larval habitats for Anopheles gambiae that are difficult to find and treat promptly. Reference is often made to the Ross-Macdonald model to reinforce the view that larval control is ineffective. This paper challenges the notion that LSM cannot be successfully used for malaria control in African transmission settings by highlighting historical and recent successes, discussing its potential in an integrated vector management approach working towards malaria elimination and critically reviewing the most common arguments that are used against the adoption of LSM.},

	abstract = {Indoor residual spray (IRS) of insecticides and insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) are the two most important malaria vector control tools in the tropical world. Application of both tools in the same locations is being implemented for malaria control in endemic and epidemic Africa. The two tools are assumed to have synergistic benefits in reducing malaria transmission because they both act at multiple stages of the transmission cycle. However, this assumption has not been rigorously examined, empirically or theoretically. Using mathematical modelling, we obtained the conditions for which a combination strategy can be expected to improve upon single control tools. Specifically, spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in all houses where residents are not using ITNs can reduce transmission of malaria (R0) by up to 10 times more than the reduction achieved through ITNs alone. Importantly, however, we also show how antagonism between control tools can arise via interference of their modes of action. Repellent IRS reduces the likelihood that ITNs are contacted within sprayed houses and ITNs reduce the rate at which blood-fed mosquitoes rest on sprayed walls. For example, 80 per cent coverage of ITNs and DDT used together at the household level resulted in an R0 of 11.1 when compared with an R0 of 0.1 achieved with 80 per cent ITN coverage without DDT. While this undesired effect can be avoided using low-repellence pyrethroid chemicals for IRS, the extent of the potential benefits is also attenuated. We discuss the impact that this result will likely have on future efforts in malaria control combination strategy.},

We compute sensitivity indices of 0 and a reactivity index (that measures epidemicity) to parameters for baseline wet and dry season values. 0 is most sensitive to the mosquito biting and death rates. The reactivity index is most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate and the infectivity of hosts to vectors. Numerical simulations show that even with low equilibrium prevalence, increases in mosquito densities through higher rainfall, in the presence of vertical transmission, can result in large epidemics.

	abstract = {Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been expanding its geographical distribution with important implications for both human and animal health. The emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing presence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and veterinary infrastructures and human morbidity, mortality, and economic endpoints. Furthermore, worldwide attention should be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV, because suitable host, vector and environmental conditions for additional epidemics likely exist on other continents; including Asia, Europe and the Americas. We propose a new compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential equations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter driven as a function of contact networks. Humans and livestock hosts and two species of vector mosquitoes are included in the model. The model is based on weighted contact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for each set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among regions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not only treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated into the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data from the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the epidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive set of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for accurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the world. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different provinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the outbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction number is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction number are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.},

	abstract = {The paper considers a model for the transmission of bilharzia based on Macdonald's assumptions, in the light of data observed in the field. It is shown, in particular, that the threshold parameter governing whether or not an endemic cycle can be established is closely related to the proportion of infected snails in a community, and that this proportion is normally observed to be rather smaller than is compatible with the model. By considering more sophisticated models, allowing for the latent period of infection in the snails, and also for spatial and seasonal heterogeneity, the effective proportion of infected snails, from the point of view of Macdonald's model, is shown to be rather larger, and expressions are given whereby it can be evaluated from observable quantities. However, for the data from Malirong which are taken as illustration, it is also demonstrated that an even more plausible threshold value is obtained from a simple model incorporating human immunity in addition to the assumptions of Macdonald's model, and that, if this model were reasonable, human immunity would appear to be the most important factor in controlling the level of the disease in Malirong.},

	abstract = {Complex, highly-computational, individual-based models are abundant in epidemiology. For epidemics such as macro-parasitic diseases, detailed modelling of human behaviour and pathogen life-cycle are required in order to produce accurate results. This can often lead to models that are computationally-expensive to analyse and perform model fitting, and often require many simulation runs in order to build up sufficient statistics. Emulation can provide a more computationally-efficient output of the individual-based model, by approximating it using a statistical model. Previous work has used Gaussian processes (GPs) in order to achieve this, but these can not deal with multi-modal, heavy-tailed, or discrete distributions. Here, we introduce the concept of a mixture density network (MDN) in its application in the emulation of epidemiological models. MDNs incorporate both a mixture model and a neural network to provide a flexible tool for emulating a variety of models and outputs. We develop an MDN emulation methodology and demonstrate its use on a number of simple models incorporating both normal, gamma and beta distribution outputs. We then explore its use on the stochastic SIR model to predict the final size distribution and infection dynamics. MDNs have the potential to faithfully reproduce multiple outputs of an individual-based model and allow for rapid analysis from a range of users. As such, an open-access library of the method has been released alongside this manuscript.},

	abstract = {The health burden of anthropogenic climate change is growing exponentially, but present-day impacts remain difficult to measure. Here, we leverage a recently-published comprehensive dataset of 50,425 population surveys to investigate whether human-caused climate change has increased the burden of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa. In historical data, we find that prevalence shows a robust response to temperature and extreme precipitation, consistent with expectations from previous empirical and epidemiological work. Comparing historical climate reconstructions to counterfactual simulations without anthropogenic warming, we find two-to-one odds that human-caused climate change has increased the overall prevalence of childhood malaria across sub-Saharan Africa since 1901. We estimate that by 2014, human-caused climate change was responsible for an average of 84 excess cases of malaria per 100,000 children ages 2 to 10, with higher elevation and cooler regions in southern and east Africa having greater increases. Under future climate change, we project increasing temperatures could plausibly accelerate the eradication of malaria in west and central Africa, where the present-day burden is highest, leading to continent-wide average reductions of 89 (low greenhouse gas emissions, SSP1-RCP2.6) to 1,750 (high emissions, SSP5-RCP8.5) cases per 100,000 children by the end of the century. However, we find that limiting future global warming to below 2 degrees C (SSP1-RCP2.6) compared to {\textasciitilde}3 degrees C (SSP2-RCP4.5) could prevent an average of 496 excess cases in southern Africa, and 40 excess cases in east Africa, per 100,000 children by 2100. Our study resolves a decades-old debate about one of the earliest health impacts of global warming, and provides a template for future work measuring the true global burden of climate change.},

	abstract = {Assessing the influence of climate on the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria worldwide and how it might impact local malaria dynamics is complex and extrapolation to other settings or future times is controversial. This is especially true in the light of the particularities of the short- and long-term immune responses to infection. In sites of epidemic malaria transmission, it is widely accepted that climate plays an important role in driving malaria outbreaks. However, little is known about the role of climate in endemic settings where clinical immunity develops early in life. To disentangle these differences among high- and low-transmission settings we applied a dynamical model to two unique adjacent cohorts of mesoendemic seasonal and holoendemic perennial malaria transmission in Senegal followed for two decades, recording daily P. falciparum cases. As both cohorts are subject to similar meteorological conditions, we were able to analyze the relevance of different immunological mechanisms compared with climatic forcing in malaria transmission. Transmission was first modeled by using similarly unique datasets of entomological inoculation rate. A stochastic nonlinear human–mosquito model that includes rainfall and temperature covariates, drug treatment periods, and population variability is capable of simulating the complete dynamics of reported malaria cases for both villages. We found that under moderate transmission intensity climate is crucial; however, under high endemicity the development of clinical immunity buffers any effect of climate. Our models open the possibility of forecasting malaria from climate in endemic regions but only after accounting for the interaction between climate and immunity.},

	abstract = {Malaria epidemics in regions with seasonal windows of transmission can vary greatly in size from year to year. A central question has been whether these interannual cycles are driven by climate, are instead generated by the intrinsic dynamics of the disease, or result from the resonance of these two mechanisms. This corresponds to the more general inverse problem of identifying the respective roles of external forcings vs. internal feedbacks from time series for nonlinear and noisy systems. We propose here a quantitative approach to formally compare rival hypotheses on climate vs. disease dynamics, or external forcings vs. internal feedbacks, that combines dynamical models with recently developed, computational inference methods. The interannual patterns of epidemic malaria are investigated here for desert regions of northwest India, with extensive epidemiological records for Plasmodium falciparum malaria for the past two decades. We formulate a dynamical model of malaria transmission that explicitly incorporates rainfall, and we rely on recent advances on parameter estimation for nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems based on sequential Monte Carlo methods. Results show a significant effect of rainfall in the inter-annual variability of epidemic malaria that involves a threshold in the disease response. The model exhibits high prediction skill for yearly cases in the malaria transmission season following the monsoonal rains. Consideration of a more complex model with clinical immunity demonstrates the robustness of the findings and suggests a role of infected individuals that lack clinical symptoms as a reservoir for transmission. Our results indicate that the nonlinear dynamics of the disease itself play a role at the seasonal, but not the interannual, time scales. They illustrate the feasibility of forecasting malaria epidemics in desert and semi-arid regions of India based on climate variability. This approach should be applicable to malaria in other locations, to other infectious diseases, and to other nonlinear systems under forcing.},

	abstract = {Background: Climate change will probably alter the spread and transmission intensity of malaria in Africa.

Objectives: In this study, we assessed potential changes in the malaria transmission via an integrated weather–disease model.

Methods: We simulated mosquito biting rates using the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM). The input data for the LMM were bias-corrected temperature and precipitation data from the regional model (REMO) on a 0.5° latitude–longitude grid. A Plasmodium falciparum infection model expands the LMM simulations to incorporate information on the infection rate among children. Malaria projections were carried out with this integrated weather–disease model for 2001 to 2050 according to two climate scenarios that include the effect of anthropogenic land-use and land-cover changes on climate.

Results: Model-based estimates for the present climate (1960 to 2000) are consistent with observed data for the spread of malaria in Africa. In the model domain, the regions where malaria is epidemic are located in the Sahel as well as in various highland territories. A decreased spread of malaria over most parts of tropical Africa is projected because of simulated increased surface temperatures and a significant reduction in annual rainfall. However, the likelihood of malaria epidemics is projected to increase in the southern part of the Sahel. In most of East Africa, the intensity of malaria transmission is expected to increase. Projections indicate that highland areas that were formerly unsuitable for malaria will become epidemic, whereas in the lower-altitude regions of the East African highlands, epidemic risk will decrease.

Conclusions: We project that climate changes driven by greenhouse-gas and land-use changes will significantly affect the spread of malaria in tropical Africa well before 2050. The geographic distribution of areas where malaria is epidemic might have to be significantly altered in the coming decades.},

	abstract = {Background With over a hundred million annual infections and rising morbidity and mortality, Plasmodium vivax malaria remains largely a neglected disease. In particular, the dependence of this malaria species on relapses and the potential significance of the dormant stage as a therapeutic target, are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings To quantify relapse parameters and assess the population-wide consequences of anti-relapse treatment, we formulated a transmission model for P. vivax suitable for parameter inference with a recently developed statistical method based on routine surveillance data. A low-endemic region in NW India, whose strong seasonality demarcates the transmission season, provides an opportunity to apply this modeling approach. Our model gives maximum likelihood estimates of 7.1 months for the mean latency and 31\% for the relapse rate, in close agreement with regression estimates and clinical evaluation studies in the area. With a baseline of prevailing treatment practices, the model predicts that an effective anti-relapse treatment of 65\% of those infected would result in elimination within a decade, and that periodic mass treatment would dramatically reduce the burden of the disease in a few years. Conclusion/Significance The striking dependence of P. vivax on relapses for survival reinforces the urgency to develop more effective anti-relapse treatments to replace Primaquine (PQ), the only available drug for the last fifty years. Our methods can provide alternative and simple means to estimate latency times and relapse frequency using routine epidemiological data, and to evaluate the population-wide impact of relapse treatment in areas similar to our study area.},

	abstract = {Development of new antimalaria strategies and particularly vaccines, needs an in-depth understanding of the relationships between transmission, infection, immunity, morbidity and mortality. The intensive and longitudinal collection of entomological, parasitological and clinical data from the Senegalese populations of Dielmo (250-300 inhabitants), exposed to a perennial and intense transmission (about 200 infective bites/person/year) and of Ndiop (300-350 inhabitants) exposed to a seasonal transmission (about 20 infective bites/person/year), allows to respond to many questions about this subject. The acquisition of an antimalaria immunity as one gets older appears to reduce parasite density, complexity of infection, risk of new patent infection after a suppressive treatment but does not reduce the prevalence (as assessed by PCR) of infection which is commonly chronic and asymptomatic. The existence of a pyrogenic threshold effect of parasitaemia allows the individual diagnosis of malaria attacks. P. falciparum genotyping suggests that successive malaria attacks are due to distinct recently inoculated parasite populations that multiply initially without restriction, a dominant population is generally responsible of the clinical manifestations and all new populations do not trigger systematically attacks. The initial intensity of clinical manifestations does not differ perceptibly among children and adults, is not related to the duration of the attacks, does not allow the distinction between several types of attacks, is not predictive of their severity, and the clearance of parasites and manifestations is longer among youngest persons. The risk of malaria attacks is lower as one gets older and among carriers of AS haemoglobin, is higher when transmission increases and during pregnancy up to three months after delivery, and vary between children. The risk of malaria attack per infective bite is negatively related to the intensity of transmission. Because of their high sensitivity in malaria case detection, this type of small community-based studies are powerful and useful for the identification of protective immunological mechanisms as well as for testing rapidly and cheaply the clinical efficacy of any intervention such as antimalarial vaccines and drug therapy or prophylaxis. As a lot of vaccine candidates and drug combinations will be screened or tested in the perspective of the 'Roll-Back Malaria' programme, more attention must be given to longitudinal studies of this type.},

The epidemiological determinants of such disparity are unclear. We used a data-mining approach to explore a nineteen-year longitudinal malaria cohort study dataset from Senegal and identify variables associated with increased risk of malaria episodes. These were then verified using classical statistics and replicated in a second cohort. In addition to age, we identified a novel high-risk group of children in whom the history of P. falciparum clinical episodes greatly increased risk of further episodes. Age and a high number of previous falciparum clinical episodes not only play major roles in explaining the risk of P. falciparum episodes but also are risk factors for different groups of people. Combined, they explain the majority of falciparum clinical attacks. Contrary to what is widely believed, clinical immunity to P. falciparum does not de facto occur following many P. falciparum clinical episodes. There exist a sub-group of children who suffer repeated clinical episodes. In addition to posing an important challenge for population stratification during clinical trials, this sub-group disproportionally contributes to the disease burden and may necessitate specific prevention and control measures.},

	abstract = {Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is the most efficient malaria vector in Africa. Recent advances in mapping the distribution of this vector have exploited the relationship between climatic factors and vector parameters such as growth, survival and reproduction. This work was designed to investigate the effect of temperature and humidity on the development and survival of the vector and to test the use of recently developed tools in describing its distribution. The development rate and survival of the aquatic stages of the vector were investigated at 16 constant temperatures. Adults were produced between 16 -34ºC with a peak development rate at 28ºC and peak number of adults at 22 -26ºC. Larvae survived for less than 7 days at 10º, 12º, 38 º, and 40ºC but for more than 5 weeks, at 14-18ºC without any development of adults. Laboratory models accurately predicted development times at natural breeding sites in The Gambia suggesting the applicability of the models to field situations. The survival and mortality rates of adult An. gambiae s.s. were monitored at combinations of temperatures from 0-45ºC at 5  intervals and 40\%, 60\%, 80\% and 100\% relative humidity.

	abstract = {Dengue is considered non-endemic to mainland China. However, travellers frequently import the virus from overseas and local mosquito species can then spread the disease in the population. As a consequence, mainland China still experiences large dengue outbreaks. Temperature plays a key role in these outbreaks: it affects the development and survival of the vector and the replication rate of the virus. To better understand its implication in the transmission risk of dengue, we developed a delay differential equation model that explicitly simulates temperature-dependent development periods and tested it with collected field data for the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. The model predicts mosquito occurrence locations with a high accuracy (Cohen’s κ of 0.78) and realistically replicates mosquito population dynamics. Analysing the infection dynamics during the 2014 dengue outbreak that occurred in Guangzhou showed that the outbreak could have lasted for another four weeks if mosquito control interventions had not been undertaken. Finally, we analyse the dengue transmission risk in mainland China. We find that southern China, including Guangzhou, can have more than seven months of dengue transmission per year while even Beijing, in the temperate north, can have dengue transmission during hot summer months. The results demonstrate the importance of using detailed vector and infection ecology, especially when vector-borne disease transmission risk is modelled over a broad range of climatic zones.},

The scale, nature and trends of tropical diseases are related to changes in environmental components, life systems and habitats, and these are analysed, with emphasis on vector-borne diseases, especially malaria. Although it is feasible to predict the consequences of changing single climatic variables for specific parts of parasite and vector life cycles, the probable effects of simultaneously changing several variables are far more difficult to predict because many qualitative and quantitative determinants of disease are likely to be affected and the effects of covariance are poorly understood. Local and specific changes are likely to overshadow more global climatic changes. The effects of global temperature rise are explored, with particular emphasis on the basic case reproduction rate for two species of human malaria parasites. Even a 2 °C temperature rise greatly increases this rate at the lower end of the temperature range compatible with transmission. The importance of secondary vectors may increase. Implications for transmission in Europe and for imported tropical diseases are discussed.},

Global warming will enable the expansion of the geographical distributions of vectors. The population dynamics of vectors will change in response to extended seasons suitable for development followed by less severe winters. The incidence of epidemics is likely to change in response to an expected disproportionate increase in the frequency of extreme climatic events. The impact of such changes on each of the major vector-borne diseases is reviewed and projections are made on the likely global areas at risk from spread of disease vectors.

Changes in the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases are some of the most widely cited potential effects of climate change, and could have significant consequences for human health as well as economic and societal impacts. These changes in disease incidence would be mediated through biologic, ecologic, sociologic, and epidemiologic processes that interact with each other and which may themselves be influenced by climate change. Although hypothesized infectious disease effects have been widely discussed, there have not yet been thorough quantitative studies addressing the many processes at work. In part this is because of the complexity of the many indirect and feedback interactions or mechanisms that bear on all aspects of the climate issue. It also results from the difficulty of including the multitude of always-changing determinants of these diseases. This paper proposes a framework for an integrated assessment of the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases. The framework allows identification of potentially important indirect interactions or mechanisms, identification of important research gaps, and a means of integrating targeted research from a variety of disciplines into an enhanced understanding of the whole system.},

The model predicted vector dynamics better in sites with a smaller proportion of young children in the population, lower mean temperature, and homes with piped water and made of cement.

	abstract = {When a rare pathogen emerges to cause a pandemic, it is critical to understand its dynamics and the impact of mitigation measures. We use experimental data to parametrize a temperature-dependent model of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission dynamics and analyse the effects of temperature variability and control-related parameters on the basic reproduction number (R0) and the final epidemic size of ZIKV. Sensitivity analyses show that these two metrics are largely driven by different parameters, with the exception of temperature, which is the dominant driver of epidemic dynamics in the models. Our R0 estimate has a single optimum temperature (≈30°C), comparable to other published results (≈29°C). However, the final epidemic size is maximized across a wider temperature range, from 24 to 36°C. The models indicate that ZIKV is highly sensitive to seasonal temperature variation. For example, although the model predicts that ZIKV transmission cannot occur at a constant temperature below 23°C (≈ average annual temperature of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), the model predicts substantial epidemics for areas with a mean temperature of 20°C if there is seasonal variation of 10°C (≈ average annual temperature of Tampa, Florida). This suggests that the geographical range of ZIKV is wider than indicated from static R0 models, underscoring the importance of climate dynamics and variation in the context of broader climate change on emerging infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {Extrinsic environmental factors influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of many organisms, including insects that transmit the pathogens responsible for vector-borne diseases (VBDs). Temperature is an especially important constraint on the fitness of a wide variety of ectothermic insects. A mechanistic understanding of how temperature impacts traits of ectotherms, and thus the distribution of ectotherms and vector-borne infections, is key to predicting the consequences of climate change on transmission of VBDs like malaria. However, the response of transmission to temperature and other drivers is complex, as thermal traits of ectotherms are typically nonlinear, and they interact to determine transmission constraints. In this study, we assess and compare the effect of temperature on the transmission of two malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, by two malaria vector species, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi. We model the nonlinear responses of temperature dependent mosquito and parasite traits (mosquito development rate, bite rate, fecundity, proportion of eggs surviving to adulthood, vector competence, mortality rate, and parasite development rate) and incorporate these traits into a suitability metric based on a model for the basic reproductive number across temperatures. Our model predicts that the optimum temperature for transmission suitability is similar for the four mosquito–parasite combinations assessed in this study, but may differ at the thermal limits. More specifically, we found significant differences in the upper thermal limit between parasites spread by the same mosquito (A. stephensi) and between mosquitoes carrying P. falciparum. In contrast, at the lower thermal limit the significant differences were primarily between the mosquito species that both carried the same pathogen (e.g., A. stephensi and A. gambiae both with P. falciparum). Using prevalence data, we show that the transmission suitability metric ST{\textbackslash} S(T) {\textbackslash} calculated from our mechanistic model is consistent with observed P. falciparum prevalence in Africa and Asia but is equivocal for P. vivax prevalence in Asia, and inconsistent with P. vivax prevalence in Africa. We mapped risk to illustrate the number of months various areas in Africa and Asia predicted to be suitable for malaria transmission based on this suitability metric. This mapping provides spatially explicit predictions for suitability and transmission risk.},

	abstract = {How a disease is transmitted affects our ability to determine R0, the average number of new cases caused by an infectious host at the onset of an epidemic. R0 becomes progressively more difficult to compute as transmission varies from directly transmitted diseases to diseases that are vector-borne to environmentally transmitted diseases. Pathogens responsible for diseases with environmental transmission are typically maintained in environmental reservoirs that exhibit a complex spatial distribution of local infectious zones (LIZs). Understanding host encounters with LIZs and pathogen persistence within LIZs is required for an accurate R0 and modeling these contacts requires an integrated geospatial and dynamical systems approach. Here we review how interactions between host and pathogen populations and environmental reservoirs are driven by landscape-level variables, and synthesize the quantitative framework needed to formulate outbreak response and disease control.},

	abstract = {Models predicting disease transmission are vital tools for long-term planning of malaria reduction efforts, particularly for mitigating impacts of climate change. We compared temperature-dependent malaria transmission models when mosquito life-history traits were estimated from a truncated portion of the lifespan (a common practice) versus traits measured across the full lifespan. We conducted an experiment on adult female Anopheles stephensi, the Asian urban malaria mosquito, to generate daily per capita values for mortality, egg production and biting rate at six constant temperatures. Both temperature and age significantly affected trait values. Further, we found quantitative and qualitative differences between temperature–trait relationships estimated from truncated data versus observed lifetime values. Incorporating these temperature–trait relationships into an expression governing the thermal suitability of transmission, relative R0(T), resulted in minor differences in the breadth of suitable temperatures for Plasmodium falciparum transmission between the two models constructed from only An. stephensi trait data. However, we found a substantial increase in thermal niche breadth compared with a previously published model consisting of trait data from multiple Anopheles mosquito species. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering how mosquito trait values vary with mosquito age and mosquito species when generating temperature-based suitability predictions of transmission.},

	abstract = {Arboviral disease transmission by Aedes mosquitoes poses a major challenge to public health systems in Ecuador, where constraints on health services and resource allocation call for spatially informed management decisions. Employing a unique dataset of larval occurrence records provided by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health, we used ecological niche models (ENMs) to estimate the current geographic distribution of Aedes aegypti in Ecuador, using mosquito presence as a proxy for risk of disease transmission. ENMs built with the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production (GARP) algorithm and a suite of environmental variables were assessed for agreement and accuracy. The top model of larval mosquito presence was projected to the year 2050 under various combinations of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and models of climate change. Under current climatic conditions, larval mosquitoes were not predicted in areas of high elevation in Ecuador, such as the Andes mountain range, as well as the eastern portion of the Amazon basin. However, all models projected to scenarios of future climate change demonstrated potential shifts in mosquito distribution, wherein range contractions were seen throughout most of eastern Ecuador, and areas of transitional elevation became suitable for mosquito presence. Encroachment of Ae. aegypti into mountainous terrain was estimated to affect up to 4,215 km2 under the most extreme scenario of climate change, an area which would put over 12,000 people currently living in transitional areas at risk. This distributional shift into communities at higher elevations indicates an area of concern for public health agencies, as targeted interventions may be needed to protect vulnerable populations with limited prior exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. Ultimately, the results of this study serve as a tool for informing public health policy and mosquito abatement strategies in Ecuador.},

The three products are African Rainfall Climatology, version 2 (ARC2); African Rainfall Estimation Algorithm, version 2 (RFE2); and 3B42 from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, version 7 (i.e., 3B42v7). Daily rainfall totals from six gauges were used to assess the accuracy of satellite-based rainfall estimates of rainfall days, daily rainfall totals, 10-day rainfall totals, monthly rainfall totals, and seasonal rainfall totals. The northern stations had a mean annual rainfall total of 1390 mm, while the southern stations had a mean annual rainfall total of 900 mm. 3B42v7 was the only product that did not underestimate boreal-summer rainfall at the northern stations, which had {\textasciitilde}3 times as much rainfall during boreal summer than did the southern stations. The three products tended to overestimate rainfall days at all stations and were borderline satisfactory at identifying rainfall days at the northern stations; the products did not perform satisfactorily at the southern stations. At the northern stations, 3B42v7 performed satisfactorily at estimating monthly and seasonal rainfall totals, ARC2 was only satisfactory at estimating seasonal rainfall totals, and RFE2 did not perform satisfactorily at any time step. The satellite products performed worst at the two stations located in rain shadows, and 3B42v7 had substantial overestimates at those stations.},

	abstract = {West-central Uganda, a biodiversity hotspot on the eastern edge of central equatorial Africa (CEA), is a region coping with balancing food security needs of a rapidly growing human population dependent on subsistence agriculture with the conservation of critically endangered species. Documenting and understanding rainfall trends is thus of critical importance in west-central Uganda, but sparse information exists on rainfall trends in CEA during the past several decades. The recently created African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) dataset has been shown to perform satisfactorily at identifying rainfall days and estimating seasonal rainfall totals in west-central Uganda. Therefore, we use ARC2 data to assess rainfall trends in west-central Uganda and other parts of equatorial Africa from 1983–2012. The core variables examined were three-month rainfall variables for west-central Uganda, and annual rainfall variables and seasonal rainfall totals for a transect that extended from northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo to southern Somalia. Significant decreases in rainfall in west-central Uganda occurred for multiple three-month periods centered on boreal summer, and rainfall associated with the two growing seasons decreased by 20 \% from 1983–2012. The drying trend in west-central Uganda extended westward into the Congo rainforest. Rainfall in CEA was significantly correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) at the annual scale and during boreal summer and autumn. Two other possible causes of the decreasing rainfall in CEA besides North Atlantic Ocean sea-surface temperatures (e.g., AMO), are the warming of the Indian Ocean and increasing concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols over tropical Africa from biomass burning.},

	abstract = {Extrinsic environmental factors influence the distribution and population dynamics of many organisms, including insects that are of concern for human health and agriculture. This is particularly true for vector-borne infectious diseases like malaria, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality in humans. Understanding the mechanistic links between environment and population processes for these diseases is key to predicting the consequences of climate change on transmission and for developing effective interventions. An important measure of the intensity of disease transmission is the reproductive number R0. However, understanding the mechanisms linking R0 and temperature, an environmental factor driving disease risk, can be challenging because the data available for parameterization are often poor. To address this, we show how a Bayesian approach can help identify critical uncertainties in components of R0 and how this uncertainty is propagated into the estimate of R0. Most notably, we find that different parameters dominate the uncertainty at different temperature regimes: bite rate from 15°C to 25°C; fecundity across all temperatures, but especially 25–32°C; mortality from 20°C to 30°C; parasite development rate at 15–16°C and again at 33–35°C. Focusing empirical studies on these parameters and corresponding temperature ranges would be the most efficient way to improve estimates of R0. While we focus on malaria, our methods apply to improving process-based models more generally, including epidemiological, physiological niche, and species distribution models.},

Here we show that across continental Africa, the estimated geographic range of climatic suitability for malaria transmission is more sensitive to the precipitation threshold than the thermal response curve applied. To address this problem we use downscaled daily climate predictions from seven GCMs to run a continental-scale hydrological model for a process-based representation of mosquito breeding habitat availability. A more complex pattern of malaria suitability emerges as water is routed through drainage networks and river corridors serve as year-round transmission foci. The estimated hydro-climatically suitable area for stable malaria transmission is smaller than previous models suggest and shows only a very small increase in state-of-the-art future climate scenarios. However, bigger geographical shifts are observed than with most rainfall threshold models and the pattern of that shift is very different when using a hydrological model to estimate surface water availability for vector breeding.},

The spatial limits of its distribution and seasonal activity are sensitive to climate factors, as well as the local capacity to control the disease. Malaria is also one of the few health outcomes that has been modeled by more than one research group and can therefore facilitate the first model intercomparison for health impacts under a future with climate change. We used bias-corrected temperature and rainfall simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models to compare the metrics of five statistical and dynamical malaria impact models for three future time periods (2030s, 2050s, and 2080s). We evaluated three malaria outcome metrics at global and regional levels: climate suitability, additional population at risk and additional person-months at risk across the model outputs. The malaria projections were based on five different global climate models, each run under four emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs) and a single population projection. We also investigated the modeling uncertainty associated with future projections of populations at risk for malaria owing to climate change. Our findings show an overall global net increase in climate suitability and a net increase in the population at risk, but with large uncertainties. The model outputs indicate a net increase in the annual person-months at risk when comparing from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5 from the 2050s to the 2080s. The malaria outcome metrics were highly sensitive to the choice of malaria impact model, especially over the epidemic fringes of the malaria distribution.},

	abstract = {Several vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, are sensitive to climate and weather conditions. When unusual conditions prevail, for example, during periods of heavy rainfall, mosquito populations can multiply and trigger epidemics. This study, which consists of better understanding the link between malaria transmission and climate factors at a national level, aims to validate the VECTRI model (VECtor borne disease community model of ICTP, TRIeste) in Senegal. The VECTRI model is a grid-distributed dynamical model that couples a biological model for the vector and parasite life cycles to a simple compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) representation of the disease progression in the human host. In this study, a VECTRI model driven by reanalysis data (ERA-5) was used to simulate malaria parameters, such as the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) in Senegal. In addition to the ERA5-Land daily reanalysis rainfall, other daily rainfall data come from different meteorological products, including the CPC Global Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Daily Precipitation (CPC for Climate Prediction Center), satellite data from the African Rainfall Climatology 2.0 (ARC2), and the Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Observed malaria data from the National Malaria Control Program in Senegal (PNLP/Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme au Senegal) and outputs from the climate data used in this study were compared. The findings highlight the unimodal shape of temporal malaria occurrence, and the seasonal malaria transmission contrast is closely linked to the latitudinal variation of the rainfall, showing a south–north gradient over Senegal. This study showed that the peak of malaria takes place from September to October, with a lag of about one month from the peak of rainfall in Senegal. There is an agreement between observations and simulations about decreasing malaria cases on time. These results indicate that the southern area of Senegal is at the highest risk of malaria spread outbreaks. The findings in the paper are expected to guide community-based early-warning systems and adaptation strategies in Senegal, which will feed into the national malaria prevention, response, and care strategies adapted to the needs of local communities.},

With the new regional VECTRI dynamical malaria model it is now possible to examine these in an integrated modelling framework. Using 5 global climate models which were bias corrected using the WATCH data for the recent ISIMIP project, the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), population projections disaggregated from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) and Land use change from the HYDE model output used in the CMIP5 process, we construct a multi-member ensemble of malaria transmission intensity projections for 2050. The ensemble integrations indicate that climate has the leading impact on malaria changes, but that population growth and urbanisation can offset the effect of climate locally. LUC impacts can also be significant on the local scale but their assessment is highly uncertain and only indicative in this study. It is argued that the study should be repeated with a range of malaria models or VECTRI configurations in order to assess the additional uncertainty due to the malaria model assumptions.},

Although malaria is climate driven, there are limited studies linking climate variability and disease transmission across the various agro-ecological zones in Ghana. We used the VECTRI (vector-borne disease community model of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste) model with a new surface hydrology scheme to investigate the spatio-temporal variability in malaria transmission patterns over the four agro-ecological zones in Ghana. The model is driven using temperature and rainfall datasets obtained from the GMet (Ghana Meteorological Agency) synoptic stations between 1981 and 2010. In addition, the potential of the VECTRI model to simulate seasonal pattern of local scale malaria incidence is assessed. The model results reveal that the simulated malaria transmission follows rainfall peaks with a two-month time lag. Furthermore, malaria transmission ranges from eight to twelve months, with minimum transmission occurring between February and April. The results further reveal that the intra- and inter-agro-ecological variability in terms of intensity and duration of malaria transmission are predominantly controlled by rainfall. The VECTRI simulated EIR (Entomological Inoculation Rate) tends to agree with values obtained from field surveys across the country. Furthermore, despite being a regional model, VECTRI demonstrates useful skill in reproducing monthly variations in reported malaria cases from Emena hospital (a peri urban town located within Kumasi metropolis). Although further refinements in this surface hydrology scheme may improve VECTRI performance, VECTRI still possesses the potential to provide useful information for malaria control in the tropics.},

	abstract = {Persistent presence of Malaria in a highly endemic region (Odisha state of India) is a matter of grave concern. However, very limited numerical modeling studies have been carried out to investigate the suitability of dynamical models to study the relationship between malaria transmission dynamics and climatic factors, and sensitivity of simulated results to model parameters. Therefore, in this study, a dynamical model (VECTRI) is used to simulate malaria transmission dynamics for the period 2000 - 2013. In the experiment, the values of parameters such as maximum and minimum temperatures for larvae survival (rlarv\_tmax, rlarv\_tmin), threshold temperature for egg development in vector (rtgono), threshold temperature for parasite development (rtsporo), degree days for parasite development (dsporo), and infiltration and evaporation rate loss of ponds (rwaterfrac\_evap126), etc. are modified to carry out a sensitivity analysis. Vector density and EIR (infective biting rate) were found to peak at rlarv\_tmin value of 16 °C. Increment in rtsporo and decrement in dsporo strongly influence EIR. EIR reached its peak when rtsporo is 22 °C and dsporo is 8 days. When rtsporo is 30 °C, EIR is close to 0, but there is no significant change in vector density. There is a successive 5\% decline in vector density and EIR values when rwaterfrac\_evap126 is increased from 130 to 200 at intervals of 10. The parameters with highest sensitivity are found to be rlarv\_tmin, rtsporo, and rwaterfrac\_evap126, and hence need to be tightly constrained by observations. Notably, the VECTRI model is rather insensitive to rlarv\_tmax, and needs further improvement for reliable simulations and future projections of malaria transmission dynamics under climate change.

	abstract = {South Africa has a target of eliminating malaria by year 2020. So far, it has successfully eradicated malaria from most parts of the country except the north-eastern province. Economic burden on the individuals and the governments due to malaria is substantial and is estimated by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA to be about US \$12 billion per year worldwide. Successful forecasting of the malaria few months in advance would reduce the economic burden on the governments. In this study we used the numerical model VECTRI (VECtor borne disease community model of ICTP, TRIeste) for forecasting the malaria cases over South Africa. The dynamically downscaled Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and seasonal forecasts from the SINTEX-F (Scale Interaction Experiment-Frontier) model initialized in September were used to forecast the malaria cases during December-February. The results indicate the VECTRI model can capture the spatial distribution of the malaria cases over the north-eastern province of South Africa realistically, though the model has biases in simulating malaria in the interior regions of South Africa.},

	abstract = {On the climate-health issue, studies have already attempted to understand the influence of climate change on the transmission of malaria. Extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, or heat waves can alter the course and distribution of malaria. This study aims to understand the impact of future climate change on malaria transmission using, for the first time in Senegal, the ICTP’s community-based vector-borne disease model, TRIeste (VECTRI). This biological model is a dynamic mathematical model for the study of malaria transmission that considers the impact of climate and population variability. A new approach for VECTRI input parameters was also used. A bias correction technique, the cumulative distribution function transform (CDF-t) method, was applied to climate simulations to remove systematic biases in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) that could alter impact predictions. Beforehand, we use reference data for validation such as CPC global unified gauge-based analysis of daily precipitation (CPC for Climate Prediction Center), ERA5-land reanalysis, Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), and African Rainfall Climatology 2.0 (ARC2). The results were analyzed for two CMIP5 scenarios for the different time periods: assessment: 1983–2005; near future: 2006–2028; medium term: 2030–2052; and far future: 2077–2099). The validation results show that the models reproduce the annual cycle well. Except for the IPSL-CM5B model, which gives a peak in August, all the other models (ACCESS1–3, CanESM2, CSIRO, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, inmcm4, and IPSL-CM5B) agree with the validation data on a maximum peak in September with a period of strong transmission in August–October. With spatial variation, the CMIP5 model simulations show more of a difference in the number of malaria cases between the south and the north. Malaria transmission is much higher in the south than in the north. However, the results predicted by the models on the occurrence of malaria by 2100 show differences between the RCP8.5 scenario, considered a high emission scenario, and the RCP4.5 scenario, considered an intermediate mitigation scenario. The CanESM2, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, inmcm4, and IPSL-CM5B models predict decreases with the RCP4.5 scenario. However, ACCESS1–3, CSIRO, NRCM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, and GFDL-ESM2M predict increases in malaria under all scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The projected decrease in malaria in the future with these models is much more visible in the RCP8.5 scenario. The results of this study are of paramount importance in the climate-health field. These results will assist in decision-making and will allow for the establishment of preventive surveillance systems for local climate-sensitive diseases, including malaria, in the targeted regions of Senegal.},

These additions allow the model to be reasonably run on resolutions down to O(10km), essentially the resolution of the population and climate input data.

	abstract = {Malaria is a critical health issue across the world and especially in Africa. Studies based on dynamical models helped to understand inter-linkages between this illness and climate. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the VECTRI community vector malaria model to simulate the spread of malaria in Cameroon using rainfall and temperature data from FEWS-ARC2 and ERA-interim, respectively. In addition, we simulated the model using five results of the dynamical downscaling of the regional climate model RCA4 within two time frames named near future (2035–2065) and far future (2071–2100), aiming to explore the potential effects of global warming on the malaria propagation over Cameroon. The evaluated metrics include the risk maps of the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) and the parasite ratio (PR). During the historical period (1985–2005), the model satisfactorily reproduces the observed PR and EIR. Results of projections reveal that under global warming, heterogeneous changes feature the study area, with localized increases or decreases in PR and EIR. As the level of radiative forcing increases (from 2.6 to 8.5 W.m−2), the magnitude of change in PR and EIR also gradually intensifies. The occurrence of transmission peaks is projected in the temperature range of 26–28 °C. Moreover, PR and EIR vary depending on the three agro-climatic regions of the study area. VECTRI still needs to integrate other aspects of disease transmission, such as population mobility and intervention strategies, in order to be more relevant to support actions of decision-makers and policy makers.},

Regionally, the intensity of malaria transmission is found to be higher in the north, central and southern districts of Odisha where the mosquito populations and the number of infective bites are more and mainly in the forest or mountainous ecotypes.

A genetic algorithm calibrates each of these three factors within their assessed prior uncertainty in turn to see which allows the best fit to a timeseries of confirmed cases. It is shown that for high altitude locations close to the threshold for transmission, the spatial representativeness uncertainty for climate, in particular temperature, dominates the uncertainty due to model parameter settings. Initial condition uncertainty plays little role after the first two years, and is thus important in the early warning system context, but negligible for decadal and climate change investigations. Thus, while reducing uncertainty in the model parameters would improve the quality of the simulations, the uncertainty in the temperature driving data is critical. It is emphasized that this result is a function of the mean climate of the location itself, and it is shown that model uncertainty would be relatively more important at warmer, lower altitude locations.},

Potential reasons for this operationalization bottleneck are discussed, which include restrictions on open access to health and climate data, the unfulfilled requirement for training in the use of such systems, and the mismatch between the prediction paradigm and the decision entry points in health-planning systems. The S2S project sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization may help to demonstrate the potential application of climate information, but the lack of real-time access inhibits the operationalization of evaluated systems. It is recommended that partnership platforms, established through the Global Framework for Climate Services and related mechanisms, enable the climate and health academic and operational communities to work together on real-time provision and assessment of health early warning systems.

	abstract = {Background The transmission of malaria is highly variable and depends on a range of climatic and anthropogenic factors. This study investigates the combined, i.e. direct and indirect, impacts of climate change on the dynamics of malaria through modifications in: (i) the sporogonic cycle of Plasmodium induced by air temperature increase, and (ii) the life cycle of Anopheles vector triggered by changes in natural breeding habitat arising from the altered moisture dynamics resulting from acclimation responses of vegetation under climate change. The study is performed for a rural region in Kilifi county, Kenya. Methods and findings We use a stochastic lattice-based malaria (SLIM) model to make predictions of changes in Anopheles vector abundance, the life cycle of Plasmodium parasites, and thus malaria transmission under projected climate change in the study region. SLIM incorporates a nonlinear temperature-dependence of malaria parasite development to estimate the extrinsic incubation period of Plasmodium. It is also linked with a spatially distributed eco-hydrologic modeling framework to capture the impacts of climate change on soil moisture dynamics, which served as a key determinant for the formation and persistence of mosquito larval habitats on the land surface. Malaria incidence data collected from 2008 to 2013 is used for SLIM model validation. Projections of climate change and human population for the region are used to run the models for prediction scenarios. Under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) only, modeled results reveal wetter soil moisture in the root zone due to the suppression of transpiration from vegetation acclimation, which increases the abundance of Anopheles vectors and the risk of malaria. When air temperature increases are also considered along with elevated [CO2], the life cycle of Anopheles vector and the extrinsic incubation period of Plasmodium parasites are shortened nonlinearly. However, the reduction of soil moisture resulting from higher evapotranspiration due to air temperature increase also reduces the larval habitats of the vector. Our findings show the complicated role of vegetation acclimation under elevated [CO2] on malaria dynamics and indicate an indirect but ignored impact of air temperature increase on malaria transmission through reduction in larval habitats and vector density. Conclusions Vegetation acclimation triggered by elevated [CO2] under climate change increases the risk of malaria. In addition, air temperature increase under climate change has opposing effects on mosquito larval habitats and the life cycles of both Anopheles vectors and Plasmodium parasites. The indirect impacts of temperature change on soil moisture dynamics are significant and should be weighed together with the direct effects of temperature change on the life cycles of mosquitoes and parasites for future malaria prediction and control.},

We integrate this model with an individual-based stochastic simulation model for malaria in humans to compare the effects of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in reducing malaria transmission, prevalence, and incidence. We show that ITNs are more effective than IRS in reducing transmission and prevalence though IRS would achieve its maximal effects within 2 years while ITNs would need two mass distribution campaigns over several years to do so. Furthermore, the combination of both interventions is more effective than either intervention alone. However, although these interventions reduce transmission and prevalence, they can lead to increased clinical malaria; and all three malaria indicators return to preintervention levels within 3 years after the interventions are withdrawn.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Good maps of malaria risk have long been recognized as an important tool for malaria control. The production of such maps relies on modelling to predict the risk for most of the map, with actual observations of malaria prevalence usually only known at a limited number of specific locations. Estimation is complicated by the fact that there is often local variation of risk that cannot be accounted for by the known covariates and because data points of measured malaria prevalence are not evenly or randomly spread across the area to be mapped.
METHOD: We describe, by way of an example, a simple two-stage procedure for producing maps of predicted risk: we use logistic regression modelling to determine approximate risk on a larger scale and we employ geo-statistical ('kriging') approaches to improve prediction at a local level. Malaria prevalence in children under 10 was modelled using climatic, population and topographic variables as potential predictors. After the regression analysis, spatial dependence of the model residuals was investigated. Kriging on the residuals was used to model local variation in malaria risk over and above that which is predicted by the regression model.
RESULTS: The method is illustrated by a map showing the improvement of risk prediction brought about by the second stage. The advantages and shortcomings of this approach are discussed in the context of the need for further development of methodology and software.},

However, recent evidence suggests that the clinical outcomes of infection are determined by the intensity of parasite exposure, and developments in geographical information systems (GIS) provide new ways to represent epidemiological data spatially. In the present study, parasitological data from 682 cross-sectional surveys conducted in Kenya were abstracted and spatially defined. Risks of infection with Plasmodium falciparum among Kenyan children, estimated from combinations of parasitological, geographical, demographic and climatic data in a GIS platform, appear to be low for 2.9 million, stable but low for another 1.3 million, moderate for 3.0 million and high for 0.8 million. (Estimates were not available for 1.4 million children.) Whilst the parasitological data were obtained from a variety of sources across different age-groups and times, these markers of endemicity remained relatively stable within the broad definitions of high, moderate and low transmission intensity. Models relating ecological and climatic features to malaria intensity and improvements in our understanding of the relationships between parasite exposure and disease outcome will hopefully provide a more rational basis for malaria control in the near future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the current biophysical models designed to address the large-scale distribution of malaria assume that transmission of the disease is independent of the vector involved. Another common assumption in these type of model is that the mortality rate of mosquitoes is constant over their life span and that their dispersion is negligible. Mosquito models are important in the prediction of malaria and hence there is a need for a realistic representation of the vectors involved.
RESULTS: We construct a biophysical model including two competing species, Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis. Sensitivity analysis highlight the importance of relative humidity and mosquito size, the initial conditions and dispersion, and a rarely used parameter, the probability of finding blood. We also show that the assumption of exponential mortality of adult mosquitoes does not match the observed data, and suggest that an age dimension can overcome this problem.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights some of the assumptions commonly used when constructing mosquito-malaria models and presents a realistic model of An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis and their interaction. This new mosquito model, OMaWa, can improve our understanding of the dynamics of these vectors, which in turn can be used to understand the dynamics of malaria.},

To address this problem, we propose combining an integrated high resolution (50 m) distributed hydrological model and remotely sensed data to simulate potential malaria vector aquatic habitats. The novelty of our approach lies in its consideration of irrigation practices and its ability to resolve complex ponding processes that contribute to potential larval habitats. The simulation was performed for the year of 2018 using ParFlow-Common Land Model (CLM) in a sugarcane plantation in the Oromia region, Ethiopia to examine the effects of rainfall and irrigation. The model was calibrated using field observations of larval habitats to successfully predict ponding at all surveyed locations from the validation dataset. Results show that without irrigation, at least half of the area inside the farms had a 40\% probability of potential larval habitat occurrence. With irrigation, the probability increased to 56\%. Irrigation dampened the seasonality of the potential larval habitats such that the peak larval habitat occurrence window during the rainy season was extended into the dry season. Furthermore, the stability of the habitats was prolonged, with a significant shift from semi-permanent to permanent habitats. Our study provides a hydrological perspective on the impact of environmental modification on malaria vector ecology, which can potentially inform malaria control strategies through better water management.},

RESULTS: Under present climatic conditions, Auckland and Northland, and some coastal areas of other northern parts of the North Island, have a potential risk for dengue outbreaks supported by the vector Aedes albopictus. Greenhouse gas induced climate change could make these areas also receptive to Aedes aegypti--the more efficient tropical dengue vector--and increase the potential distribution of A. albopictus to much of the South Island.

	abstract = {The current global geographic distribution of malaria results from a complex interaction between climatic and non-climatic factors. Over the past century, socio-economic development and public health measures have contributed to a marked contraction in the distribution of malaria. Previous assessments of the potential impact of global changes on malaria have not quantified the effects of non-climate factors. In this paper, we describe an empirical model of the past, present and future-potential geographic distribution of malaria which incorporates both the effects of climate change and of socio-economic development. A logistic regression model using temperature, precipitation and gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) identifies the recent global geographic distribution of malaria with high accuracy (sensitivity 85\% and specificity 95\%). Empirically, climate factors have a substantial effect on malaria transmission in countries where GDPpc is currently less than US\$20,000. Using projections of future climate, GDPpc and population consistent with the IPCC A1B scenario, we estimate the potential future population living in areas where malaria can be transmitted in 2030 and 2050. In 2050, the projected population at risk is approximately 5.2 billion when considering climatic effects only, 1.95 billion when considering the combined effects of GDP and climate, and 1.74 billion when considering GDP effects only. Under the A1B scenario, we project that climate change has much weaker effects on malaria than GDPpc increase. This outcome is, however, dependent on optimistic estimates of continued socioeconomic development. Even then, climate change has important effects on the projected distribution of malaria, leading to an increase of over 200 million in the projected population at risk.},

We used a genetic algorithm to optimize a spatiotemporal malaria model by aggregating locations into clusters with similar environmental sensitivities. We tested the algorithm in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia using seven years of weekly Plasmodium falciparum data from 47 districts and remotely-sensed land surface temperature, precipitation, and spectral indices as predictors. The best model identified six clusters, and the districts in each cluster had distinctive responses to the environmental predictors.

Since 2019, a local team at Bahir Dar University in Ethiopia has been using EPIDEMIA to produce weekly malaria forecasting reports. Intensive anti-malarial eﬀorts in the Amhara region of Ethiopia have resulted in declining malaria incidence, with a 75\% decrease in cases between 2013 and 2018 (561,101 to 137,445 cases). In this context of potentially changing malaria transmission patterns, continual model evaluation past the initial model development is warranted. We built model validation and assessment tools into the epidemiar R package for on-demand evaluation for any historical period. Validation statistics included Mean Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and proportion of observations that fell inside the prediction intervals. Evaluation can be made for one through n-week ahead predictions, and include comparisons with two na¨ıve models: persistence of last known value, and average cases from that week of the year. Building validation into the early warning system provides more opportunities to learn about the model via the validation results. We can identify locations where the models perform best with district-level results. With on-demand implementation and time-range ﬂexibility, we can also investigate how accuracy changes over time, which is of particular interest in places like Ethiopia with changing patterns and declining trends due to anti-malarial programs.},

	abstract = {Background
Once malaria occurs, deaths can be prevented by prompt treatment with relatively affordable and efficacious drugs. Yet this goal is elusive in Africa. The paradox of a continuing but easily preventable cause of high mortality raises important questions for policy makers concerning care-seeking and access to health systems. Although patterns of care-seeking during uncomplicated malaria episodes are well known, studies in cases of fatal malaria are rare. Care-seeking behaviours may differ between these groups.

Methods
This study documents care-seeking events in 320 children less than five years of age with fatal malaria seen between 1999 and 2001 during over 240,000 person-years of follow-up in a stable perennial malaria transmission setting in southern Tanzania. Accounts of care-seeking recorded in verbal autopsy histories were analysed to determine providers attended and the sequence of choices made as the patients' condition deteriorated.

Results
As first resort to care, 78.7\% of malaria-attributable deaths used modern biomedical care in the form of antimalarial pharmaceuticals from shops or government or non-governmental heath facilities, 9.4\% used initial traditional care at home or from traditional practitioners and 11.9\% sought no care of any kind. There were no differences in patterns of choice by sex of the child, sex of the head of the household, socioeconomic status of the household or presence or absence of convulsions. In malaria deaths of all ages who sought care more than once, modern care was included in the first or second resort to care in 90.0\% and 99.4\% with and without convulsions respectively.

Conclusions
In this study of fatal malaria in southern Tanzania, biomedical care is the preferred choice of an overwhelming majority of suspected malaria cases, even those complicated by convulsions. Traditional care is no longer a significant delaying factor. To reduce mortality further will require greater emphasis on recognizing danger signs at home, prompter care-seeking, improved quality of care at health facilities and better adherence to treatment.},

This study was conducted in ten indicator villages (based on malaria incidence and entomological indices) in mountainous/hilly and plain regions situated south and southeastern Iran. Mosquito vectors were collected from indoor as well as outdoor shelters and the blood meals were examined by ELISA test. Over all 7654 female Anopheles spp. were captured, the most common species were Anopheles stephensi, An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis, and An. d'thali. The overall human blood index was 37.50\%, 19.83\%, 16.4\%, and 30.1\% for An. fluviatilis, An. stephensi, An. culicifacies, and An. d'thali, respectively. In addition, An. fluviatilis fed on human blood during the entire year but the feeding behavior of An. stephensi and An. culicifacies varied according to seasons. Overall, the abundance of the female mosquito positive to human blood was 4.25\% per human shelter versus 17.5\% per animal shelter. This result indicates that the vectors had tendency to rest in animal shelters after feeding on human. Therefore, vector control measure should be planned based on such as feeding pattern, abundance, and resting behavior of these vectors in the area.},

This study aimed at identifying post-referral treatment-seeking pathways that lead to appropriate antimalarial treatment for children less than five years with suspected severe malaria. An observational study in Uganda enrolled children below five years presenting to CHWs with signs of severe malaria. Children were followed up 28 days after enrolment to assess their condition and treatment-seeking history, including referral advice and provision of antimalarial treatment from visited providers. Of 2211 children included in the analysis, 96\% visited a second provider after attending a CHW. The majority of CHWs recommended caregivers to take their child to a designated RHF (65\%); however, only 59\% followed this recommendation. Many children were brought to a private clinic (33\%), even though CHWs rarely recommended this type of provider (3\%). Children who were brought to a private clinic were more likely to receive an injection than children brought to a RHF (78\% vs 51\%, p{\textless}0.001) and more likely to receive the second or third-line injectable antimalarial (artemether: 22\% vs. 2\%, p{\textless}0.001, quinine: 12\% vs. 3\%, p{\textless}0.001). Children who only went to non-RHF providers were less likely to receive an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) than children who attended a RHF (odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95\% CI 0.51–0.79, p{\textless}0.001). Children who did not go to any provider after seeing a CHW were the least likely to receive an ACT (OR = 0.21, 95\% CI 0.14–0.34, p{\textless}0.001). Health policies should recognise local treatment-seeking practices and ensure adequate quality of care at the various public and private sector providers where caregivers of children with suspected severe malaria actually seek care.},

The open-ended WHO global eradication effort began in 1955 ended in 1969 and consumed ≍15 million during the 1958–1963 period of progress, mainly provided by the United States. Intensified antimalaria interventions continued after Congress discontinued direct support. Although malariological research was discouraged during the period of time limitation, it was embraced as the conceptual basis for the open-ended period of intervention that followed. This effort saved many lives but expended our ability to intervene against future epidemics and reduced human herd immunity.

	abstract = {The conceptual basis of public health entomology developed at the turn of the twentieth century with the seminal experiments that guided the first vector-directed interventions. Within 50 years, technological advances built confidence in the power of research to resolve threats posed by vector-borne pathogens. Hope that the resulting diseases might be eliminated by time-limited interventions, however, soon became remote, thereby intensifying research efforts in vector biology. Beginning in the 1960s, US investigator-initiated grant proposals in vector biology were reviewed by a panel of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that considered all proposals relating to `Tropical Medicine and Parasitology' (TMP). Following the recommendation of a conference held in 1978, proposals relating to insect physiology came to be reviewed by TMP. A standing `ad hoc entomology'study section was formed in 1982 to deal with this influx of proposals. Another conference, held in 1993, encouraged consideration of proposals relating to vector transgenics by that study section. By 1994, this diversion caused the community of US public health entomologists to petition, in vain,for a return to the original concept of vector biology. By 2003, so many molecular proposals were submitted that entomological studies containing a field component were removed to an epidemiological study section distinct from TMP. In 2002, only half as many vector biology training programs could be identified in the US as in 1982, with a proportionate loss of associated faculty. A conference convened by the Institute of Medicine in 2003 concluded that the `human resource capacity' in the US suitable for dealing with vector-related issues in health should be rebuilt. Although the development of such a discipline would depend largely on the system of investigator-initiated research proposals awarded by NIH, private donors and foundations seem likely to play an important role in this dynamic. The meld of vector biology, insect physiology and vector transgenics that will characterize the faculty that produces this new generation of public health entomologists remains to be defined.},

	abstract = {The Asian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is a well-known and important vector of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Until 2013, its geographical distribution was confined to central and southern Asia including the Arabian Peninsula. In the Horn of Africa (HoA) Region, An. stephensi was first recorded from Djibouti in 2012, when it was linked geographically and temporally with an unusual outbreak of urban P. falciparum malaria. In 2016, An. stephensi was detected in the neighbouring Somali Region of Ethiopia. In order to determine whether An. stephensi populations have become established in Djibouti and contributed to the unusual rise in local malaria cases there, we carried out continuous vector surveillance from January 2013 to December 2017, investigated seasonal changes in An. stephensi population densities and bionomics, analysed available literature describing malaria in Djibouti since 2013, and investigated whether An. stephensi may have contributed to local malaria transmission by detecting circumsporozoite antigen of P. falciparum and P. vivax in female anophelines. From 2013 to 2016, seasonal activity of An. stephensi in urban Djibouti City primarily occurred during the colder, wetter season between September and May, with either no or rare trap catches from June to August. Unlike past years, this species was detected year-round, including the extremely hot summer months of June to August 2017. This change in seasonal occurrence may indicate that An. stephensi populations are adapting to their new environment in sub-Saharan Africa, facilitating their spread within Djibouti City. Among the 96 female An. stephensi investigated for malaria infectivity, three (3.1\%) were positive for P. falciparum circumsporozoite antigen, including one P. falciparum/P. vivax VK 210 double infection. Subsequent to the unusual resurgence of local malaria in 2013, with 1684 confirmed cased reported for that year, malaria case numbers increased continuously, peaking at 14,810 in 2017. Prior to 2016, only P. falciparum malaria cases had been reported, but in 2016, autochthonously acquired P. vivax malaria cases occurred for the first time at a rate of 16.7\% among all malaria cases recorded that year. This number increased to 36.7\% in 2017. Our data indicate that the dynamics of malaria species in Djibouti is currently changing rapidly, and that An. stephensi can be involved in the transmission of both P. falciparum and P. vivax, simultaneously. Considering the extremely high potential impact of urban malaria on public health, the timely deployment of optimal multinational vector surveillance and control programs against An. stephensi is strongly recommended, not only for the HoA Region, but for the entire African continent.},

	abstract = {Background: Climate change is expected to have a range of health impacts, some of which are already apparent. Public health adaptation is imperative, but there has been little discussion of how to increase adaptive capacity and resilience in public health systems.

Objectives: We explored possible explanations for the lack of work on adaptive capacity, outline climate–health challenges that may lie outside public health’s coping range, and consider changes in practice that could increase public health’s adaptive capacity.

Methods: We conducted a substantive, interdisciplinary literature review focused on climate change adaptation in public health, social learning, and management of socioeconomic systems exhibiting dynamic complexity.

Discussion: There are two competing views of how public health should engage climate change adaptation. Perspectives differ on whether climate change will primarily amplify existing hazards, requiring enhancement of existing public health functions, or present categorically distinct threats requiring innovative management strategies. In some contexts, distinctly climate-sensitive health threats may overwhelm public health’s adaptive capacity. Addressing these threats will require increased emphasis on institutional learning, innovative management strategies, and new and improved tools. Adaptive management, an iterative framework that embraces uncertainty, uses modeling, and integrates learning, may be a useful approach. We illustrate its application to extreme heat in an urban setting.

Conclusions: Increasing public health capacity will be necessary for certain climate–health threats. Focusing efforts to increase adaptive capacity in specific areas, promoting institutional learning, embracing adaptive management, and developing tools to facilitate these processes are important priorities and can improve the resilience of local public health systems to climate change.},

	abstract = {Five years of sustained indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide from 2014 to 2019, first using a carbamate followed by an organophosphate, was associated with a marked reduction in the incidence of malaria in five districts of Uganda. We assessed changes in malaria incidence over an additional 21 months, corresponding to a change in IRS formulations using clothianidin with and without deltamethrin. Using enhanced health facility surveillance data, our objectives were to 1) estimate the impact of IRS on monthly malaria case counts at five surveillance sites over a 6.75 year period, and 2) compare monthly case counts at five facilities receiving IRS to ten facilities in neighboring districts not receiving IRS. For both objectives, we specified mixed effects negative binomial regression models with random intercepts for surveillance site adjusting for rainfall, season, care-seeking, and malaria diagnostic. Following the implementation of IRS, cases were 84\% lower in years 4–5 (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 0.16, 95\% CI 0.12–0.22), 43\% lower in year 6 (aIRR = 0.57, 95\% CI 0.44–0.74), and 39\% higher in the first 9 months of year 7 (aIRR = 1.39, 95\% CI 0.97–1.97) compared to pre-IRS levels. Cases were 67\% lower in IRS sites than non-IRS sites in year 6 (aIRR = 0.33, 95\% CI 0.17–0.63) but 38\% higher in the first 9 months of year 7 (aIRR = 1.38, 95\% CI 0.90–2.11). We observed a resurgence in malaria to pre-IRS levels despite sustained IRS. The timing of this resurgence corresponded to a change of active ingredient.

	abstract = {It has become established practice during the past 20 years to use high-resolution historical rainfall time series as input to hydrological model packages for detailed simulation of urban drainage systems. However, sufficiently long rain series are rarely available from the exact catchment in question and simulations are hence often based on available rain series from other locations. Extreme rainfall properties of importance to the performance of urban storm drainage systems vary significantly even in regions with only minor physiographic differences. Part of this variation can be explained by regional variations of the mean annual rainfall and the remaining statistical residue can be interpreted as statistical uncertainty. In Denmark, more than 75 high-resolution rain gauges are installed across a total area of 43,000 m. About 40 gauges had sufficiently long records to be included in a comprehensive national investigation where newly developed statistical regionalisation procedures were used to model the regional variation of extreme rainfalls. On this basis, a spreadsheet model was made available for estimation of extreme design rainfalls and the associated uncertainty at any location in the country. Statistics were furthermore computed to classify historical rainfall time series according to the developed regional model, and this makes it possible to assess the uncertainty related with using different historical rain series for simulations at ungauged locations. This research indicates that use of historical point rainfall data at ungauged locations introduces a significant uncertainty that is largely overlooked in today's practice. The engineering recommendation is to select historical rain series based on an evaluation of the local physiographic characteristics (e.g., the mean annual rainfall) and a (pre-defined) desired safety level of the simulations.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologic patterns of malaria infection are governed by environmental parameters that regulate vector populations of Anopheles mosquitoes. The intensity of malaria parasite transmission is normally expressed as the entomologic inoculation rate (EIR), the product of the vector biting rate times the proportion of mosquitoes infected with sporozoite-stage malaria parasites. Malaria transmission intensity in Africa is highly variable with annual EIRs ranging from {\textless} 1 to {\textgreater} 1,000 infective bites per person per year. Malaria control programs often seek to reduce morbidity and mortality due to malaria by reducing or eliminating malaria parasite transmission by mosquitoes. This report evaluates data from 31 sites throughout Africa to establish fundamental relationships between annual EIRs and the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection. The majority of sites fitted a linear relationship (r2 = 0.71) between malaria prevalence and the logarithm of the annual EIR. Some sites with EIRs {\textless} 5 infective bites per year had levels of P. falciparum prevalence exceeding 40\%. When transmission exceeded 15 infective bites per year, there were no sites with prevalence rates {\textless} 50\%. Annual EIRs of 200 or greater were consistently associated with prevalence rates {\textgreater} 80\%. The basic relationship between EIR and P. falciparum prevalence, which likely holds in east and west Africa, and across different ecologic zones, shows convincingly that substantial reductions in malaria prevalence are likely to be achieved only when EIRs are reduced to levels less than 1 infective bite per person per year. The analysis also highlights that the EIR is a more direct measure of transmission intensity than traditional measures of malaria prevalence or hospital-based measures of infection or disease incidence. As such, malaria field programs need to consider both entomologic and clinical assessments of the efficacy of transmission control measures.},

	abstract = {The presence of multiple genetically different pathogenic variants within the same individual host is common in infectious diseases. Although this is neglected in some diseases, it is well recognized in others like malaria, where it is typically referred to as multiplicity of infection (MOI) or complexity of infection (COI). In malaria, with the advent of molecular surveillance, data is increasingly being available with enough resolution to capture MOI and integrate it into molecular surveillance strategies. The distribution of MOI on the population level scales with transmission intensities, while MOI on the individual level is a confounding factor when monitoring haplotypes of particular interests, e.g., those associated with drug-resistance. Particularly, in high-transmission areas, MOI leads to a discrepancy between the likelihood of a haplotype being observed in an infection (prevalence) and its abundance in the pathogen population (frequency). Despite its importance, MOI is not universally defined. Competing definitions vary from verbal ones to those based on concise statistical frameworks. Heuristic approaches to MOI are popular, although they do not mine the full potential of available data and are typically biased, potentially leading to misinferences. We introduce a formal statistical framework and suggest a concise definition of MOI and its distribution on the host-population level. We show how it relates to alternative definitions such as the number of distinct haplotypes within an infection or the maximum number of alleles detectable across a set of genetic markers. It is shown how alternatives can be derived from the general framework. Different statistical methods to estimate the distribution of MOI and pathogenic variants at the population level are discussed. The estimates can be used as plug-ins to reconstruct the most probable MOI of an infection and set of infecting haplotypes in individual infections. Furthermore, the relation between prevalence of pathogenic variants and their frequency (relative abundance) in the pathogen population in the context of MOI is clarified, with particular regard to seasonality in transmission intensities. The framework introduced here helps to guide the correct interpretation of results emerging from different definitions of MOI. Especially, it excels comparisons between studies based on different analytical methods.},

Individual participant data were pooled from 15 studies (n = 3736 individuals).Multiclonal asymptomatic infections were associated with a somewhat increased subsequent risk of clinical malaria in the youngest children, followed by an initial declining risk with age irrespective of transmission intensity. At approximately 5 years of age, the risk continued the gradual decline with age in high-transmission settings. However, in older children in moderate-, low-, and seasonal-transmission settings, multiclonal infections were either not significantly associated with the risk of subsequent febrile malaria or were associated with an increased risk.The number of clones in asymptomatic P. falciparum infections is associated with different risks of subsequent clinical malaria depending on age and transmission intensity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Encouraging progress has been seen with reductions in Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in some parts of Africa. Reduced transmission might lead to increasing susceptibility to malaria among older children due to lower acquired immunity, and this has implications for ongoing control strategies.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a longitudinal observational study of children admitted to Kilifi County Hospital in Kenya and linked it to data on residence and insecticide-treated net (ITN) use. This included data from 69,104 children aged from 3 mo to 13 y admitted to Kilifi County Hospital between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2014. The variation in malaria slide positivity among admissions was examined in logistic regression models using the following predictors: location of the residence, calendar time, the child's age, ITN use, and the enhanced vegetation index (a proxy for soil moisture). The proportion of malaria slide-positive admissions declined from 0.56 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.58) in 1998 to 0.07 (95\% CI 0.06-0.08) in 2009 but then increased again through to 0.24 (95\% CI 0.22-0.25) in 2014. Older children accounted for most of the increase after 2009 (0.035 [95\% CI 0.030-0.040] among young children compared to 0.22 [95\% CI 0.21-0.23] in older children). There was a nonlinear relationship between malaria risk and prevalence of ITN use within a 2 km radius of an admitted child's residence such that the predicted malaria positive fraction varied from {\textasciitilde}0.4 to {\textless}0.1 as the prevalence of ITN use varied from 20\% to 80\%. In this observational analysis, we were unable to determine the cause of the decline in malaria between 1998 and 2009, which pre-dated the dramatic scale-up in ITN distribution and use.
CONCLUSION: Following a period of reduced transmission, a cohort of older children emerged who have increased susceptibility to malaria. Further reductions in malaria transmission are needed to mitigate the increasing burden among older children, and universal ITN coverage is a promising strategy to achieve this goal.},

In children with acute infection anaemia was most marked during the period after treatment. Although many of these patients developed a positive direct Coombs test during this period of the illness it is not clear whether the anaemia which occurs after treatment has an immune basis. A second group of children showed quite different haematological findings. They appear to have a more chronic form of P. falciparum malaria infection, were profoundly anaemic at presentation, showed gross dyserythropoietic changes in their bone marrows, and had a full reticulocyte response and rise in haemoglobin after treatment. A third group of children were encountered whose haematological abnormalities were intermediate to those of the acute and chronic groups. These findings indicate that the patho-physiological mechanisms responsible for the anaemia ofP. falciparum malaria are different at different stages of the illness.},

	abstract = {We examine the evolutionary stability of strategies for dispersal in heterogeneous patchy environments or for switching between discrete states (e.g. defended and undefended) in the context of models for population dynamics or species interactions in either continuous or discrete time. There have been a number of theoretical studies that support the view that in spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant environments there will be selection against unconditional, i.e. random, dispersal, but there may be selection for certain types of dispersal that are conditional in the sense that dispersal rates depend on environmental factors. A particular type of dispersal strategy that has been shown to be evolutionarily stable in some settings is balanced dispersal, in which the equilibrium densities of organisms on each patch are the same whether there is dispersal or not. Balanced dispersal leads to a population distribution that is ideal free in the sense that at equilibrium all individuals have the same fitness and there is no net movement of individuals between patches or states. We find that under rather general assumptions about the underlying population dynamics or species interactions, only such ideal free strategies can be evolutionarily stable. Under somewhat more restrictive assumptions (but still in considerable generality), we show that ideal free strategies are indeed evolutionarily stable. Our main mathematical approach is invasibility analysis using methods from the theory of ordinary differential equations and nonnegative matrices. Our analysis unifies and extends previous results on the evolutionary stability of dispersal or state-switching strategies.},

	abstract = {Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing. Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects, the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver. For these projects, monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites, and the emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes, within intervention sites. This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable. Additionally, insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible. To this end, we present MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE): a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for, namely: i) resources required by mosquitoes (e.g., food sources and aquatic breeding sites) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape, ii) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex, the current state of their gonotrophic cycle (if female) and resource attractiveness, and iii) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile. Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland, Australia, and ii) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance.},

First, mobile phone usage data and ferry traffic between Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania were re-analyzed using a model of heterogeneous travel risk. Second, a dynamic mathematical model of importation and transmission rates was used.Zanzibar residents traveling to malaria endemic regions were estimated to contribute 1-15 times more imported cases than infected visitors. The malaria importation rate was estimated to be 1.6 incoming infections per 1,000 inhabitants per year. Local transmission was estimated too low to sustain transmission in most places.Malaria infections in Zanzibar largely result from imported malaria and subsequent transmission. Plasmodium falciparum malaria elimination appears feasible by implementing control measures based on detecting imported malaria cases and controlling onward transmission.},

	abstract = {Temporal variations of blood parasite density were evaluated in a longitudinal study of young, asymptomatic men in a village with endemic malaria in Mali (West Africa). Our main intention was to challenge the value of a single measure of parasite density for the diagnosis of malaria, and to define the level of endemicity in any given area. Parasitaemia and body temperature were recorded three times a day in the wet season (in 39 subjects on 12 days) and in the dry season (in 41 subjects on 13 days). Two thousand nine hundred and fifty seven blood smears (98.5\% of the expected number) were examined for malaria parasites. We often found 100-fold or greater variations in parasite density within a 6-hour period during individual follow-up. All infected subjects had frequent negative smears. Although fever was most likely to occur in subjects with a maximum parasite density exceeding 10000 parasites/mm3 (P = 0.009), there was no clear relationship between the timing of these two events. Examples of individual profiles for parasite density and fever are presented. These variations (probably due to a ‘sequestration-release’ mechanism, which remains to be elucidated) lead us to expect a substantial impact on measurements of endemicity when only a single sample is taken. In this study, the percentage of infected individuals varied between 28.9\% and 57.9\% during the dry season and between 27.5\% and 70.7\% during the wet season. The highest rates were observed at midday, and there were significant differences between days. Thus, high parasite density sometimes associated with fever can no longer be considered as the gold standard in the diagnosis of malaria. Other approaches, such as decision-making processes involving clinical, biological and ecological variables must be developed, especially in highly endemic areas where Plasmodium infection is the rule rather than the exception and the possible causes of fever are numerous.},

	abstract = {Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters such as census population size and survival for fish of interest to fisheries and conservation. These methods have advantages over traditional mark-recapture methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with parameter estimation. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and novel biocontrol strategies. Here, we extend CKMR methods to the life history of mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for mother-offspring, father-offspring, full-sibling and half-sibling pairs, where an individual in each pair may be a larva, pupa or adult. A pseudo-likelihood approach is used to combine the marginal probabilities of all kinship pairs. To test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating mosquito demographic parameters, we develop an individual-based model of mosquito life history incorporating egg, larva, pupa and adult life stages. The simulation labels each individual with a unique identification number, enabling close-kin relationships to be inferred for sampled individuals. Using the dengue vector Aedes aegypti as a case study, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased estimates of adult census population size, adult and larval mortality rates, and larval life stage duration for logistically feasible sampling schemes. Considering a simulated population of 3,000 adult mosquitoes, estimation of adult parameters is accurate when ca. 40 adult females are sampled biweekly over a three month period. Estimation of larval parameters is accurate when adult sampling is supplemented with ca. 120 larvae sampled biweekly over the same period. The methods are also effective at detecting intervention-induced increases in adult mortality and decreases in population size. As the cost of genome sequencing declines, CKMR holds great promise for characterizing the demography of mosquitoes and comparable insects of epidemiological and agricultural significance.},

	abstract = {Mosquito dispersal plays an important role in mosquito ecology and mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. While reaction-diffusion and patch-based models with simple flux assumptions for emigration have played a predominant role in modeling mosquito dispersal, mosquito behavioral ecology -- in particular, the process of searching for resources -- is usually not considered in diffusion-based models. We thus set out to analyze mosquito movement using highly mimetic models, to see what we could learn from an alternative approaches. Here, we explore mosquito dispersal in behavioral state microsimulation models, in which mosquitoes are in behavioral states and search for the required resources that are distributed on a landscape. Models of this sort are laborious and challenging to work with, so we developed ramp.micro, an R package to build, solve, analyze, and visualize behavioral state microsimulation models for mosquitoes. We show that even when resources are distributed randomly and uniformly, mosquito populations tend to form highly spatially structured communities. We also show that some heterogeneity in mosquito population densities is attributed to features of a network defined by the spatial distribution of resources. These models highlight the importance of understanding mosquito behaviors and resource availability as factor structuring mosquito population movement. Motivated by these dynamics, spatial models for mosquito ecology and mosquito-borne pathogen transmission would benefit from considering resource availability as a factor affecting mosquito movement and dispersal.},

	abstract = {The epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria presents a unique set of challenges due to the complicated dynamics of infection, immunity, disease, and detection. Studies of malaria epidemiology commonly measure malaria parasite densities or prevalence, but since malaria is so complex with so many factors to consider, a complete mathematical synthesis of malaria epidemiology has been elusive. Here, we take a new approach. From a simple model of malaria exposure and infection in human cohorts as they age, we develop random variables describing the multiplicity of infection (MoI) and the age of infection (AoI). Next, using the MoI and AoI distributions, we develop random variables describing parasite densities, parasite counts, and detection. We also derived a random variable describing the age of the youngest infection (AoY), which can be used to compute approximate parasite densities in complex infections. Finally, we derive a simple system of differential equations with hybrid variables that track the mean MoI, AoI and AoY, and we show it matches the complex probabilistic system with reasonable accuracy. We can thus compute the state of any individual chosen at random from the population in two ways. The same approach - pairing random variables and hybrid models - can be extended to model other features of malaria epidemiology, including disease, malaria immunity, treatment and chemoprotection, and infectiousness. The computational simplicity of hybrid models has some advantages over compartmental models and stochastic individual-based models, and with the supporting probabilistic framework, provide a sound basis for a synthesis of observational malaria epidemiology.},
