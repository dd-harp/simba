We present algorithms that *fit* mechanistic malaria models to time series data.

We have developed methods to fit models to *Pf*PR time series data. The two algorithms we describe herein are *forced* at different points: 

+ **History of Exposure** -- Let $E(t)$ denote the population average daily entomological inoculation rate;  

+ **History of Emergence** -- Let $\Lambda(t)$ denote the average daily emergence rate of adult mosquitoes;
