title: "`MicroMoB`"
---

[`MicroMoB`](https://dd-harp.github.io/MicroMoB/) is an R-package available from github. It was the first R package that we developed with a modular design. `MicroMoB` is still available from github, but it is not under active development. 

To install `MicroMoB,` run the following lines of code in an R session:
 
```{r, eval=F}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("dd-harp/MicroMoB")
```

`MicroMoB` is no longer under active development. It has been superceded by **`ramp.xds`.**
