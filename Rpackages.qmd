## SimBA

The SimBA suite includes five R packages:

-   [ramp.xds](ramp.xds.html) includes core computation to build and solve dynamical systems models for the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens.

    -   `ramp` stands for **R**obust **A**nalytics for **M**alaria **P**olicy. RAMP is a set of workflows and concepts that rely on **SimBA** software to develop robust analytics for Adaptive Malaria Control.

    -   `xds` stands for *e**X**tensible **D**ynamical **S**ystems*

-   [**`ramp.library`**](ramp.library.html) is a code library for **`ramp.xds`** that has encoded model families or modules for the core dynamical components.

-   [**`ramp.control`**](ramp.control.html) is a code library for **`ramp.xds`** that holds a set of algorithms to implement various models of vector control and health-based malaria interventions

-   [**`ramp.forcing`**](ramp.forcing.html) is a set of algorithms to implement exogenous forcing by weather

-   [**`ramp.work`**](ramp.work.html) is a set of algorithms and functions to apply the models to various tasks
