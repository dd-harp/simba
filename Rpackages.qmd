**RAMP** stands for **R**obust **A**nalytics for **M**alaria **P**olicy. RAMP is a set of workflows and concepts that rely on **SimBA** software to develop robust analytics for Adaptive Malaria Control.

SimBA includes 5 software packages that do core computation built around [ramp.xds](ramp.xds.html) that implement a modular framework for model building describe in *Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission* [@WuSL2023SpatialDynamics]. We also describe two supplementary packages that handle some aspects of malaria epidemiology and microsimulation, as well as some older software packages that are deprecated.   

## Core Computation 

-   [ramp.xds](ramp.xds.html) includes core computation to build and solve dynamical systems models for the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens.

    - all packages are `ramp` branded
    
    - `xds` stands for *e**X**tensible **D**ynamical **S**ystems*

-   [**`ramp.library`**](ramp.library.html) is a code library for **`ramp.xds`** that has encoded model families or modules for the core dynamical components.

-   [**`ramp.control`**](ramp.control.html) is a code library for **`ramp.xds`** that holds a set of algorithms to implement various models of malaria control, including vector control, mass drug administration, *etc.*

-   [**`ramp.forcing`**](ramp.forcing.html) is a set of algorithms to implement exogenous forcing by weather and other factors

-   [**`ramp.work`**](ramp.work.html) is a set of algorithms and functions to apply the models to various tasks

## Microsimulation

Two packages have been developed by our team for behavioral state models for mosquitoes and microsimulation: 

+ [`ramp.micro`](ramp.micro.html) was developed to explore complexity in mosquito ecology through the development and analysis of simulation models describing mosquito behavioral & spatial dynamics on point sets representing resources, which we call micro-simulation [@PerkinsTA2013HeterogeneityMixing;@CastellanosHMS2025MosquitoDispersal]

+ [`MBITES`](https://github.com/dd-harp/MBITES) is an individual-based simulation model developed to explore mosquito behavioral states [@WuSL2020MBITES]. 


## Malaria Epidemiology  

In [`ramp.falciparum`](ramp.falciparum.html), we explore malaria epidemiology, defined in the narrow sense to describe human exposure to malaria and infection, immunity, disease, drug taking, diagnostics and detection, and infectiousness [@HenryJM2025ProbabilisticSynthesis]. 

## Deprecated

Before [`ramp.xds`](ramp.xds.html), the basic development was happening in two other packages: 

-   [exDE](exDE.html)

-   [MicroMoB](MicroMoB.html)
