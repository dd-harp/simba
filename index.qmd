We have developed software -- R packages available from github --  to support **Sim**ulation-**B**ased **A**nalytics (**SimBA**) and research for malaria and other mosquito-borne pathogens. The **SimBA** software suite was developed around 
the R package [**`ramp.xds`**](ramp.xds.html): 

+ `ramp` stands for **R**obust **A**nalytics for **M**alaria **P**olicy. RAMP is a set of workflows and concepts that rely on **SimBA** software to develop robust analytics for Adaptive Malaria Control. 

+ `xds` stands for *e**X**tensible **D**ynamical **S**ystems* 

The **SimBA** software suite includes four satellite packages: 

+ [**`ramp.library`**](ramp.library.html) is a code library for **`ramp.xds`** that holds model families or modules for the core dynamical components.  

+ [**`ramp.control`**](ramp.control.html) is a code library for **`ramp.xds`** that holds a set of algorithms to implement various models of vector control and health-based malaria interventions   

+ [**`ramp.forcing`**](ramp.forcing.html) is a set of algorithms to implement exogenous forcing by weather 

+ [**`ramp.work`**](ramp.work.html) is a set of algorithms and functions to apply the models to various tasks 

Each one of the R packages documents its own code and functionality. **SimBA** extends the package-specific documentation to demonstrate the capabilities of the whole package. On this website, we also discuss several related [R packages](Rpackages.html) and other software that we've been involved with over the years but that are not part of **SimBA.** 

## Design 

The **SimBA** software is based on a rigorous mathematical framework for modular model building for mosquito-transmitted pathogens, published as [*Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010684) and inherits its code base and core ideas from `exDE` (see below). 

**SimBA** was designed with several goals: 

+ The software should lower the costs of building, analyzing, solving, and using dynamical systems models describing the epidemiology, spatial transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. 

+ The models should also serve as a basis for exploring mosquito ecology and responses to vector control, with the capability to handle forcing by weather and other exogenous variables.

+ The software should be *extensible* to facilitate development of models with unbounded complexity. The software should support nimble model building and scalable complexity.  

+ The software libraries should eventually include verified code replicating the models from most published studies. 

## History 

Publication of [*Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010684) was accompanied by a software package called  [`exDE`](https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/). After publication, we began the work to extend `exDE` to handle exogenous forcing motivated by the need to understand malaria transmission as a *changing baseline* that has been *modified by malaria control.* By April 2024, we had added new features and found good solutions for most of the technical challenges, so we turned our attention to updating 
[`MicroMoB`](https://dd-harp.github.io/MicroMoB/), software published before `exDE` that was developed to handle discrete-time systems. We soon recognized the benefit of merging the two, giving rise to **`ramp.xds`,** which is under active development. The two older software packages, `exDE` and `MicroMoB` are no longer under active development.
