```{r}
library(ramp.xds)
```

## My First Model

With **`ramp.xds`** it's this easy to build and solve a model:

```{r, echo=T}
mod <- xds_setup()
mod <- xds_solve(mod)
```

`mod` is called an **`xds`** model object.

## Basic Visualization

It's also easy to visualize the outputs:

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12, echo=T}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
xds_plot_EIR(mod)
xds_plot_PR(mod)
```
