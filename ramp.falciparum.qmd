Malaria epidemiology, including exposure, infection, disease, immunity, infectiousness, human behavior and genetics, and malaria diagnostics & detection comprise a difficult and set of issues. Some of this is explored in a software package that implements some ideas and algorithms developed by John Henry as part of his PhD research at the University of Washington.

The software is available for download at github: [dd-harp/ramp.falciparum](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.falciparum/)
