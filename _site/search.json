The tendency for local systems to be peculiar was described in 1937 by Lewis Hackett:\n\nâ€¦malaria is so moulded and altered by local conditions that it becomes a thousand different diseases and epidemiological puzzles. Like chess, it is played with a few pieces, but is capable of an infinite variety of situations."
