What determines the shape of that distribution over various time scales? What are some good time scales over which to characterize variance in risk?\nWhile it is tempting to characterize risk over daily intervals, it is possible that variance in exposure among individuals varies over longer time scales due to all the factors that drive mosquito blood feeding: noisy mosquito population dynamics driven by wind and weather affecting the search for heterogeneously distributed resources; and human mobility patterns driven by behavioral cycles over weeks or longer.\nWe thus consider a related family of distributions where we assume that mean and the variance are functions of time.

We let \\(Z_i(t)\\) denote a vector of functions describing the expected density of mosquitoes over time in the \\(i^{th}\\) patch. For this analysis, we assume that \\(Z_i(t) =Z_i(t+365)\\) for all patches (there is a canonical seasonal signal with no trend across years). Mosquito density is highly heterogeneous within a patch over time, and it can vary enormously among patches and throughout the year. We also assume the number of humans and other blood hosts varies over time.\n\n\nHeterogeneous Local Exposure\nA human population is subdivided into multiple strata, \\(H\\). We think of each stratum as having a home, or a residence where they spend their time, but they move around, spending time among the patches. Each stratum also has a search weight that describes how available they are to blood feeding mosquitoes, and a vector describes time spent in the patches by time of day. Since blood feeding activity can vary over the course of a day, time spent by time of day is converted into time at risk, which is a matrix \\(\\Psi(t).\\) Human availability is \\[W= \\Psi \\cdot w H\\] Other hosts may also be available (denoted \\(O\\)), and blood feeding rates by mosquitoes are computed as a function of availability: \\[f(t) = F_f(W(t)+O(t))\\] and bites are allocated in proportion to availability so the human fraction: \\[q(t) = \\frac{W(t)}{W(t)+O(t)}\\] From these assumptions, we can generate the expected daily EIR by computing a matrix, \\(\\beta\\). The daily EIR in the strata is \\[E(t) = \\beta(t) \\cdot  f(t)\\; q(t)\\; Z(t)\\] The dEIR is thus computed as an interaction among humans and mosquitoes.\nWhile \\(E(t)\\) returns a vector describing the expected number of infected bites per person over time. We are also interested in its distribution of \\(E(t)\\)for a homogenous population stratum. We imagine that human exposure is actually quite noisy. On the one hand, mosquito populations are distributed heterogeneously within a patch and over time, driven by wind, searching, resources and other factors. Similarly, human time spent can vary over time. We imagine that blood feeding rates vary among individuals depending on the specific path they walked during a day, as well as the number of other humans who were also available. This heterogeneity involving encounters between humans and mosquitoes is called environmental heterogeneity.\nThe mathematical formulation for environmental heterogeneity assumes that \\(E(t)\\) has a distribution for an otherwise homogeneous population stratum. The null assumption is that \\(E(t)\\) has no variance; in this case, the number of bites per person would be a Poisson. If, on the other hand, we assume that \\(E(t)\\) is gamma distributed, then the number of infective bites per person would be a negative binomial (Appendix.) The daily force of infection, dFoI or \\(h\\), is modeled as a function: \\[h(t) = F_h(b, E(t))\\]where \\(b\\) is a vector describing the probability of infection per bite, which includes inefficient transmission of sporozoites during the infective bite and effects of immunity. This represents a fully specified model for heterogeneous local exposure.\nThere are multiple ways of computing local exposure. One way that is highly convenient acknowledges that whatever we assume about mosquito density, human behavior, and blood feeding, the relevant measure of exposure is the set of dEIR values and the derived dFoI values from the shape of \\(F_h.\\)\nIf we let \\(\\bar E(t)\\) denote the mean EIR in a population, then we can write \\[E(t) = \\omega(t) S(t) \\bar E\\]where the \\(\\omega\\) is a vector of frailties: heterogeneous biting quantified through relative rates of exposure. The function \\(S(t)\\) describes the seasonal pattern. The function \\(F_h\\) fixes environmental heterogeneity.\nWe are interested in understanding the PfPR as we change \\(\\bar E\\) subject to assumptions about heterogeneous biting frailties, seasonality, and environmental heterogeneity."

RAMP is a bespoke inferential system for malaria policy, a broad set of concepts and workflows designed around SimBA software to develop Robust Analytics for Adaptive Malaria Control.\nxds stands for eXtensible Dynamical Systems\n\nThe SimBA software suite includes four satellite packages for ramp.xds:\n\nramp.library is a code library for ramp.xds with model families or modules for the core dynamical components.\nramp.control is a code library for ramp.xds with algorithms to implement various models of vector control and health-based malaria interventions\nramp.forcing is a code library for ramp.xds with algorithms to implement exogenous forcing by weather\nramp.work is a set of algorithms and functions to apply the models to various tasks\n\nEach one of the R packages documents its own code, and some vignettes have been written that describe each individual software package. This website, SimBA, extends the package-specific documentation to demonstrate the capabilities of the whole package. The website also discusses some related R packages and other software that were developed by some of us over the years that are not part formally of SimBA.\n\nDesign\nThe SimBA software is based on a rigorous mathematical framework for modular model building for mosquito-transmitted pathogens, published as Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission. It inherits its code base and core ideas from exDE (see below).\nSimBA was designed with several goals:\n\nThe software should lower the costs of building, analyzing, solving, and using dynamical systems models describing the epidemiology, spatial transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens.\nThe models should also serve as a basis for exploring mosquito ecology and responses to vector control, with the capability to handle forcing by weather and other exogenous variables.\nThe software should be extensible to facilitate development of models with unbounded complexity. The software should support nimble model building and scalable complexity.\nThe software libraries should eventually include verified code replicating the models from most published studies.\n\nThe vignettes and documents on this website are designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the SimBA suite of R packages.\n\n\nHistory\nPublication of Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission was accompanied by a software package called exDE. After publication, we began the work to extend exDE to handle exogenous forcing motivated by the need to understand malaria transmission as a changing baseline that has been modified by malaria control. By April 2024, we had added new features and found good solutions for most of the technical challenges, so we turned our attention to updating MicroMoB, software published before exDE that was developed to handle discrete-time systems. We soon recognized the benefit of merging the two, giving rise to ramp.xds, which is under active development. The two older software packages, exDE and MicroMoB are no longer under active development.\n\nWu SL, et al. (2023) Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission.

    "text": "George Macdonald’s model for mosquito infection dynamics has played an important role in the study of malaria epidemiology and transmission.\nMacdonald’s Model can be found in three journal articles published in 1952-1953. In 1952, George Macdonald published The analysis of the sporozoite rate1. Later that year, in The analysis of equilibrium in malaria2, Macdonald presented a formula for the basic reproduction rate of malaria parasites, now often called \\(R_0\\) (pronounced R-naught). Macdonald gives credit to his colleague Armitage for the mathematics. Armitage’s paper, A note on the epidemiology of malaria3 would appear in 1953, but it did not present the formula for the sporozoite rate as the steady state of a system of differential equations.\nA module called macdonald was included in ramp.library as an example of a module that was not extensible. The model was formulated as a system of delay differential equations, and the formulation of the non-autonomous model (e.g. with forcing due to weather or vector control) required some new mathematics. (This is, perhaps, why compartment models are so commonly used.) A fully extensible delay differential equation model that extends Macdonald’s model is the generalized, non-autonomous Ross-Macdonald module GeRM.\nIn the following, we present a version of Macdonald’s model. Next, we present an extension of Macdonald’s model that is extensible, published by Joan Aron and Robert M. May in 1982. Finally, we present macdonald as an autonomous spatial version of Macdonald’s model."
