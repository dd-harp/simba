    "text": "George Macdonald’s model for mosquito infection dynamics has played an important role in the study of malaria epidemiology and transmission.\nMacdonald’s Model can be found in three journal articles published in 1952-1953. In 1952, George Macdonald published The analysis of the sporozoite rate1. Later that year, in The analysis of equilibrium in malaria2, Macdonald presented a formula for the basic reproduction rate of malaria parasites, now often called \\(R_0\\) (pronounced R-naught). Macdonald gives credit to his colleague Armitage for the mathematics. Armitage’s paper, A note on the epidemiology of malaria3 would appear in 1953, but it did not present the formula for the sporozoite rate as the steady state of a system of differential equations.\nA module called macdonald was included in ramp.library as an example of a module that was not extensible. The model was formulated as a system of delay differential equations, and the formulation of the non-autonomous model (e.g. with forcing due to weather or vector control) required some new mathematics. (This is, perhaps, why compartment models are so commonly used.) A fully extensible delay differential equation model that extends Macdonald’s model is the generalized, non-autonomous Ross-Macdonald module GeRM.\nIn the following, we present a version of Macdonald’s model. Next, we present an extension of Macdonald’s model that is extensible, published by Joan Aron and Robert M. May in 1982. Finally, we present macdonald as an autonomous spatial version of Macdonald’s model.",

The dynamics are given by: \\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = a x (1-y) - g y\\] Let \\(z\\) denote the fraction of mosquitoes that are infectious. The model is a delay differential equation.
